I have a problem at work. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science,
I have been in IT industry for nine years. First two years I worked for other 
company as Java developer. The last six years I've worked and still working for the current company - Total energies.
When I joined Total energies in 2019 I was given ecommerce engineer job title, 
this is what they called DevOps engineer at the time. 
But because I didn't have any DevOps experience I was given grade C job level,
normally it would've been grade NP-10. The salary I was given was 30000 also because I had no DevOps experience.
I spent one year doing this job and then my manager suggested 
I take one additional work which is not related to DevOps the task was coordinating 
releases basically making records in a spreadsheet.  He said we need to help to free
someone so they can do what ever is required. I was told I'll be doing the same job plus 
this additionally task. But when I agreed suddenly someone from service desk contacted me
about moving my desk and then my manager told me that I will no longer be doing DevOps 
but this new task pluse another task called applying data patches which is a primitive
task no skills required. Also, the manage told me that I will join the developers
team and in the future will be doing developer job, so I agreed. Someone took my place the DevOps job.
I spent three years doing  this - release coordinator and applying datapatch, 
I did not get any new skills and my salary  did not change because of low skilled job only inflation increase so after four years the
salary I got was 34k.
I consider these three years a waist of time. Also, my job title was change to "release coordinator".
The developers job that I was promised did not materialise.
Now I can see they used me to do just to coordinate releases and apply data patches.
After these three years someone who took my job as DevOps engineer left the company and my manage at the time
suggested I move back to do the DevOps job, so I agreed. And   DevOps team  got more work so the company
decided to get one more additional DevOps engineer.  So the devops team now would become three people - me,
devops team leader and one more member, three members  would share all the work equally.
The company advertised for DevOps engineer with at least four years experience and the salary 55000.
They found new devops engineer his name is Khalid.  I expected that I would get my job title
back and having spent one year doing DevOps I should have a salary increase. Now two years
passed and now I have three years DevOps experience. My manage is happy with me, he even said that
I'm doing better than Khalid.  but my job title is now downgraded it is DevOps technician
and the salary is still the same 34k. So the situation
now is my job title downgraded compare to when I started working for the company -
six years ago and the salary considering inflation is less than six years ago.
Last month I had a meeting with my manager Prakash and told him that I want my
job title  back, and now I deserve grade NP-10 because I have now tree year DevOps experience.
The salary when you look at market average 35k is junior position or entry level and 45k -55k 
is experience devops positon. Considering  Khalid's salary 55k or so, me having now three years experience should be
somewhere close to 55k anyway I said that I think 45k would be reasonable. It has been now one month since the meeting
I did not get any updated until I asked and Prakash said  the update is "it did not happen". Prakash said that he spoke to
his boss - Andrew and Andrew spoke to his boss Cedric - the IT department director. Even Prakash said he himself spoke to Cedric
which to me seems like a lie.
