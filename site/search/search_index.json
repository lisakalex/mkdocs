like an engineer \ud83d\udd0d\ud83d\ude97!</p> <p>In the Mercedes-Benz C200 MHEV EQ Boost (48V mild hybrid) system, the braking energy recovery (regenerative braking) works by capturing kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost as heat, and converting it into electrical energy to recharge the battery and assist the engine.</p> <p>\ud83d\udc49 Now the numbers:</p> <ul> <li>Standard ICE (internal combustion engine) cars: Lose nearly 100% of braking energy as heat (zero recovery).</li> <li> <p>MHEV systems like EQ Boost: Typically recover about 10% to 25% of the total energy expended by the engine during normal driving cycles, depending on:</p> <ul> <li>Driving style.</li> <li>Urban vs. highway conditions.</li> <li>Frequency of braking.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Example calculation:</p> <ul> <li>In stop-start city driving (best case for regen), the system might recover up to \\~15\u201320% of total kinetic energy.</li> <li>In highway driving (less braking), the recovery is much lower, around 5\u201310%.</li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udee0\ufe0f In terms of engine power equivalence:</p> <ul> <li>The EQ Boost system offers up to \\~10 kW (about 14 hp) of extra electric assist.</li> <li>That\u2019s small compared to the 135+ kW petrol engine (about \\~7% of peak power), but its main strength is in filling torque gaps and saving fuel, especially at low speeds.</li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udca1 To summarize:</p> <ul> <li>The regen system can recover around 10\u201325% of the car\u2019s usable kinetic energy during braking, which lowers fuel consumption and emissions by
