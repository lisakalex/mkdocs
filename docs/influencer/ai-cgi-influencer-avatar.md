# AI + CGI influencer avatar

Excellent — here’s a **fully free (or nearly free) workflow** for creating your own **AI + CGI influencer avatar**, using tools that don’t need paid subscriptions.
You’ll be able to test everything end-to-end — from design → script → voice → video → post — **without recording yourself or spending money upfront**.

## **Step-by-Step: Create Your Free AI + CGI Avatar**

### **1. Design Your Character (Free CGI Layer)**

**Tool:** [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/)
**Why:** 100 % free, browser-based, realistic 3-D avatar creator.

**How to do it**

1. Visit Ready Player Me → “Create Avatar.”
2. Upload a selfie or choose features manually.
3. Pick clothing and background style that match your niche (tech, crypto, coding).
4. Export a PNG render or GLB model if you want to animate later.

### **2. Write a Short Script**

**Tool:** ChatGPT (you can use me)

**Prompt example**

> “Write a 60-second script explaining what Docker is for beginners, in a friendly, confident tone.”

Keep it around **100–130 words** for a 1-minute clip.

### **3. Generate a Voice-Over (Free Tier)**

**Tools (choose one):**

* [Murf.ai](https://murf.ai) – free trial for a few minutes of voice time.
* [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) – free tier allows short realistic clips.
* [Play.ht](https://play.ht) – also has a free starter plan.

**Steps**

1. Paste your script.
2. Select a clear, neutral voice (UK or US accent).
3. Download the MP3 output.

---

### **4. Turn It into a Video**

**Option A – Talking Avatar (no 3-D animation):**

* **Tool:** [HeyGen Free Plan](https://www.heygen.com/) → pick a free avatar, upload voice, or use built-in speech.
* Upload your MP3 and script; export a 720 p video (watermark ok for testing).

**Option B – Slides + Voice (educational style):**

* **Tool:** [Canva Video Editor](https://www.canva.com/videos/) or [Pictory Free Trial](https://pictory.ai).
* Add stock clips, your avatar image, captions, and voice-over MP3.
* Export as an MP4 tutorial.

**Option C – Screen + AI Voice (for coding demos):**

* Record screen with **OBS Studio (free)** while showing code.
* Overlay the AI voice-over using any free video editor (Shotcut, CapCut, or Canva).

### **5. Branding & Posting**

1. Make social handles: **YouTube Shorts, TikTok, Twitter/X, LinkedIn.**
2. Upload 1 short (≤ 60 s) video every few days.
3. Use hashtags like `#AIinfluencer #Python #DevOps #TechTips`.
4. Engage with comments as your avatar persona.

---

### **6. Optional Animation (Free 3-D Motion)**

If you want your Ready Player Me model to move:

* Import GLB file into **Blender** or **Mixamo** (free from Adobe) to auto-apply gestures or lip-sync.
* Render as short clips and reuse them in videos.
