These references align directly with our discussion: never store secrets in `pom.xml`, use encrypted `settings.xml` for
build/deploy creds, and split responsibilities (developers for runtime secrets, DevOps for pipeline injection). For
deeper dives, start with the Apache and OWASP guides—they're free and actionable.
