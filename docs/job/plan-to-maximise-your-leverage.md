# Plan to maximise your leverage

Here’s a **step-by-step tactical plan** to maximise your leverage and protect yourself when dealing with a company that has more institutional power. It treats your situation as a **strategic negotiation** rather than a simple request.

---

## **1. Establish a formal, undeniable record**

* **Document everything**: your responsibilities, achievements, promotions, verbal promises, and any emails from managers.
* **Create a PDF summary** (you’ve already done this). This acts as **evidence**, making it hard for them to deny your claims.
* **Send written communications** via email, copying relevant managers and HR. Always request **acknowledgement** and **timelines**.

**Effect:** Reduces the company’s ability to “spin” the story or stall verbally.

---

## **2. Benchmark yourself**

* **Collect market data**: Glassdoor, Reed, Totaljobs, other DevOps salaries.
* Compare your current title, responsibilities, and salary to peers both internally (Khalid) and externally.
* **Highlight discrepancies** in your communication — not emotionally, but factually.

**Effect:** Shifts the discussion from “opinions” to **objective, data-driven arguments**.

---

## **3. Escalate strategically**

* **CC multiple relevant parties**: HR, your manager, and your manager’s manager.
* If a manager like Prakash tries to “filter” or stall, the record is visible to higher levels.
* Include a **reasonable deadline** (7 working days) for acknowledgment or next steps.

**Effect:** Forces action or a formal response, preventing indefinite stalling.

---

## **4. Neutralise verbal manipulation**

* Don’t rely on promises from friendly but noncommittal managers (Andrew, Prakash).
* If someone gives a verbal promise, **follow up immediately in writing** summarising the conversation.
* Phrase it neutrally:

> “Thanks for our discussion today. As discussed, I understand X and will follow up. Please confirm in writing if I have captured this correctly.”

**Effect:** Converts verbal assurances into **traceable evidence**, preventing delays or spin.

---

## **5. Leverage internal and external comparisons**

* Show your **actual work vs. title** and the internal benchmark (e.g., Khalid’s NP‑10 DevOps Engineer salary).
* Highlight market rates for someone with your experience.
* Keep tone professional: **facts, not complaints or accusations**.

**Effect:** Shows fairness and reasonableness while signalling that ignoring the issue could create legal or HR liability.

---

## **6. Prepare alternative options**

* **Know your market value**: explore other DevOps roles externally.
* If necessary, you can **mention (subtly) that you are aware of market norms** and are evaluating your options, without threatening directly.
* This gives you psychological leverage: the company knows you have alternatives, reducing their ability to ignore your case.

**Effect:** Shifts balance — you are **not desperate**, but informed and empowered.

---

## **7. Keep communication controlled**

* Never argue in email; stick to **neutral, factual language**.
* Keep emotions out; frame your request as **alignment with company policies, market standards, and fairness**.
* Avoid repeated verbal follow-ups — let the **formal email trail** do the work.

**Effect:** Prevents the company from painting you as unreasonable, which is often used to stall or discredit requests.

---

### **Summary of approach**

Think of it as a **strategic chess game**:

* **You:** well-documented, prepared, armed with data, keeping records, professional, aware of market and internal benchmarks.
* **Company:** has experience, institutional knowledge, and the ability to stall — but now your **formal record neutralises their advantage**.

If you follow this plan, you:

1. Make it impossible to ignore or misrepresent your case.
2. Increase the likelihood of a fair outcome.
3. Keep options open if they don’t respond.

If you want, I can **draft a visual “battle map” for your case** — showing your leverage points, the company’s moves, and your next actions week by week. It works like a strategic timeline to maximise your chance of success.

Do you want me to make that?
