# Strategic “battle map"

Here’s your **strategic “battle map”** — a clear, practical timeline showing exactly what to do week by week to shift leverage from the company to you while staying completely professional.

---

## **ALEX’S JOB GRADE & SALARY REVIEW STRATEGY**

**Objective:** Secure job title correction (DevOps Engineer, Grade NP-10) and salary realignment (£45k–£50k).
**Opponent:** Institutional delay and filtering by management.
**Duration:** 6–8 weeks maximum.

---

### **PHASE 1 — Establish the Record (Week 0–1)**

**Goal:** Make your case official and unspinnable.

**Actions**

* Send your **formal email + PDF** to HR and CC Prakash + Andrew.
* Request written acknowledgement and timeline (“within 7 working days”).
* Save a **copy of the sent email and delivery confirmation** (this is your foundation).

**Expected company move:**
They may ignore or give a vague reply (“we’re looking into it”).

**Your counter:**
If no reply in 7 days → send a polite follow-up:

> “Just following up on my email dated [date]. Could you please confirm receipt and advise on next steps?”

---

### **PHASE 2 — Force Visibility (Week 2–3)**

**Goal:** Bring your case to senior management’s attention and HR records.

**Actions**

* If no concrete response from HR or Andrew after follow-up, forward your email to Andrew directly (CC HR):

  > “Dear Andrew, I wanted to confirm whether my request for a grade and salary review has been reviewed by senior management. I’d appreciate clarity on the next steps or any decision made so far.”
* This **forces Andrew to confirm** whether he actually spoke to Cedric.

**Expected company move:**
Andrew may attempt to placate you with friendly talk (“We’re reviewing this internally”).

**Your counter:**

* Thank him, then immediately follow up by email summarising what he said:

  > “Thanks for our conversation today. As discussed, I understand you will review this further with Cedric or HR. Please let me know once there’s an update.”

---

### **PHASE 3 — Control the Narrative (Week 4)**

**Goal:** Prevent management from reshaping the story.

**Actions**

* Document any new interactions in a **private log** (date, who said what).
* If HR or management provides vague or verbal answers, follow up in writing.
* Keep tone neutral, fact-based — no emotion.

**Expected company move:**
They may delay (“budget cycle”, “next quarter”, “policy alignment”).

**Your counter:**
Acknowledge politely but keep a timestamped record:

> “Understood. Could you please confirm in writing when the next review cycle will occur so I can plan accordingly?”

This eliminates excuses later.

---

### **PHASE 4 — Build External Leverage (Week 5–6)**

**Goal:** Make yourself non-dependent on their goodwill.

**Actions**

* Quietly **update your CV and LinkedIn** with your DevOps duties and skills.
* **Apply or interview** for roles at your true market level (£45k–£55k).
* Keep notes of market offers or recruiter feedback.

**Why:**
Even if you prefer to stay, this gives you **real leverage**. If HR stalls, you can later say:

> “I’ve received interest externally in similar roles at market-aligned salaries, but I would prefer to continue contributing here if we can align my grade accordingly.”

That’s not a threat — it’s leverage backed by facts.

---

### **PHASE 5 — Resolution or Exit (Week 7–8)**

**Goal:** Close the loop — achieve your raise/title or prepare to move.

**Scenario A:** HR acknowledges and reviews → cooperate fully, provide any documents they ask.
**Scenario B:** Still silence or stalling → prepare to exit on your own terms.

If you decide to move on:

* Use your **documented history** and **PDF summary** in interviews to demonstrate resilience and professionalism.
* Show that you performed at a higher level than your title, which justifies a **higher salary band** in your next role.

### **Psychological Strategy Summary**

| Company tactic                                  | Your counter-move                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vague feedback (“it didn’t happen”)             | Written follow-up requesting confirmation                        |
| Friendly verbal talk (Andrew softens tone)      | Reply with written summary of discussion                         |
| Delay or budget excuse                          | Ask for a documented review timeline                             |
| Silence                                         | Polite follow-up after 7 working days                            |
| Minimisation (“Technician is same as Engineer”) | Present market data and internal comparison (Khalid NP-10, £55k) |

---

### **Expected Outcome**

By **Week 8**, you will either:
✅ Have a formal review and likely raise/title adjustment **or**
✅ Have solid documentation and external options to negotiate from strength.

Either way, you’ll no longer be dependent on vague promises or filtered messages.
