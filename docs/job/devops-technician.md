# DevOps Technician

The title **“DevOps Technician”** is **not standard** in the industry, and at a salary of **£34,000**, it’s clearly
below the usual range for someone doing genuine DevOps work.

Let’s break this down:

---

### **1. DevOps Technician – not a recognised standard title**

In the UK (and globally), standard DevOps titles typically look like this:

| Level                | Common Title                                                | Typical UK Salary Range |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Entry / Junior**   | *Junior DevOps Engineer*, *Associate DevOps Engineer*       | £35,000 – £45,000       |
| **Mid-level**        | *DevOps Engineer*, *Platform Engineer*                      | £45,000 – £60,000       |
| **Senior**           | *Senior DevOps Engineer*, *Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)* | £60,000 – £80,000+      |
| **Lead / Principal** | *Lead DevOps Engineer*, *Principal Engineer*                | £75,000 – £100,000+     |

The title **“DevOps Technician”** is rare. When it’s used at all, it usually refers to:

* A **junior or support role** (someone assisting with CI/CD tools, basic server maintenance, or ticket work).
* A position **below engineer level**, not responsible for design, automation, or infrastructure ownership.

If your current responsibilities include **CI/CD pipelines, build/release automation, deployments, infrastructure, and
environment support**, you are *not* a “technician.” You’re doing **Engineer-level work**.

### **2. Salary comparison**

For the UK (including regional variation):

| Role                      | Experience | Typical Salary (UK 2025) | Sources                                                                                     |
|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Mid-Level DevOps Engineer | 2–5 years  | £45,000 – £55,000        | [Reed Salary Guide](https://www.reed.co.uk/average-salary/devops-engineer)                  |
| Senior DevOps Engineer    | 5+ years   | £55,000 – £75,000        | [Totaljobs](https://www.totaljobs.com/salary-checker/average-devops-engineer-salary)        |

Your current salary of **£34,500** is:

* Below even the *junior* DevOps Engineer average.
* Consistent instead with roles like *IT Support Technician*, *Operations Analyst*, or *Junior Systems Administrator* —
  not a DevOps Engineer.

---

### **3. Why this matters**

By giving you the title “DevOps Technician”:

* The company can **justify a lower grade (C)** and lower pay bracket.
* On paper, you look like a *support worker* rather than an *automation/infrastructure engineer*.
* This hurts both your **career progression** and your **market value** if not corrected.

You’re right to push for your original title back — *DevOps Engineer (Grade NP-10)* — because that’s the industry
standard and matches your work.

---

### **4. Conclusion**

No — “DevOps Technician” is **not standard**, and **£34k** is **undervalued** for anyone doing genuine DevOps work.
Your true equivalent market title and pay should be:

* **Title:** DevOps Engineer
* **Experience level:** Mid-level (3 years)
* **Market salary:** £45,000–£55,000
