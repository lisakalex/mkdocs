# Dealers common tricks 2

# Common dealer tactics (what they do) and how to spot them

1. **Dynamic pricing / price testing**

    * What: they raise/lower price to see who bites or to match market demand.
    * Spot: price changed after you showed interest; price differs between platforms.
2. **Anchoring (high list, expect to haggle)**

    * What: list a high price so any discount feels like a win.
    * Spot: initial price is high but “recently reduced” language appears.
3. **Fake scarcity / “someone else viewing”**

    * What: imply other buyers waiting to push you to decide quickly.
    * Spot: vague claims, no proof; timeline pressure without holding the car.
4. **Bait-and-switch**

    * What: advertise one car, show a different one in person or add faults that reduce value.
    * Spot: listing details don’t match the actual car or photos differ from the car shown.
5. **Stock syndication confusion**

    * What: they list the car across many sites; each listing differs slightly to justify price changes.
    * Spot: same reg on multiple sites with different prices/specs.
6. **Up-sell & add-ons at sale**

    * What: tack on warranty, prep fees, admin fees, paint sealants, GAP insurance.
    * Spot: fees appear on final paperwork or are suddenly “recommended” at handover.
7. **Deposit leverage**

    * What: take a small deposit that’s non-refundable or hard to get back to lock you in.
    * Spot: deposit terms vague or aggressive pressure after deposit.
8. **Selective disclosure of service history**

    * What: show only favourable parts of service history or omit missing/late services.
    * Spot: gaps in DSB, missing invoices, or later admission that some work wasn’t done.
9. **Cosmetic hiding / recon work**

    * What: surface repairs, poor paintwork, tyre/trim swaps to hide damage until after sale.
    * Spot: close-up photos missing, panel gaps inconsistent, tyres mismatched.
10. **“Approved Used” comfort shading**

    * What: use “approved” branding but vary warranty length / coverage across dealers.
    * Spot: ask for the actual Approved Used paperwork and check expiry/cover.

# How to expose / neutralise each trick (exact actions)

* If price increased after your interest:

    * Ask for the **timestamped listing URL** you first saw and a screenshot of the new listing. Ask: “Why was the price
      increased and when?” Demand a written justification.
* If they claim other buyers or urgency:

    * Reply: “If someone puts a deposit down I’ll expect you to notify me and hold the car for 24 hours. Otherwise I’m
      happy to continue looking.”
* If they push extras at handover:

    * Insist: “I will not sign for any extras not shown in writing on the purchase order. Any extras must be agreed in
      writing beforehand.”
* If deposit terms are unclear:

    * Never pay a non-refundable deposit unless you have written terms (how to get it back, how long they will hold).
* If service history is incomplete:

    * Demand Mercedes DSB printout (or scanned invoices) for **every** service after the date you saw in the DSB. If
      they can’t provide, treat as missing — adjust price.
* If listing differs from car:

    * Ask for **VIN** and the **factory build sheet** (shows actual original options). Compare line-by-line with
      listing.
* If they use “approved used” language:

    * Ask to see the **Approved Used certificate** and warranty start/end dates plus what’s excluded.

# Exact messages / scripts to use (copy/paste)

1. To ask why price changed:

> Hi — I noticed the price for [reg / model] changed from £22,318 to £22,652 after our last conversation. Please can you
> confirm (a) why the price increased, (b) the date/time the change was made, and (c) whether you will honour the earlier
> price if I decide to buy today? Please reply in writing.

2. To request proof and documentation:

> Please send (PDFs or clear photos): full Mercedes Digital Service Book (all pages), the VIN / build sheet, all MOT
> certificates, Approved Used warranty paperwork (with expiry), and a current dashboard photo showing mileage. I will not
> book a viewing without those.

3. If they pressure you about “other buyers”:

> I understand there may be interest. I’m happy to proceed but only on these terms: you put the car on hold for 24 hours
> while I arrange funds/inspection, with a refundable deposit of £200 payable by card. If someone else commits before
> that, please inform me immediately.

4. If they try last-minute add-ons at sign-up:

> I will only sign the sale once the final purchase order matches exactly what was agreed in writing (price, items
> included, warranty). No extras will be added at handover.

# Negotiation playbook (step-by-step)

1. **Collect facts first** (VIN, DSB, MOTs, photos, warranty). Nothing else matters without these.
2. **Price benchmarks**: find 3 comparable approved-used cars in your area (same spec, similar mileage) and use them as
   comparables. Quote those listings during negotiation.
3. **If service gaps exist**: estimate cost to do the missing service(s) and deduct from asking price; present it in
   writing. Example: “I will offer £19,500 because it needs a full service and two tyres (£1,800).”
4. **Bundle demands**: if you want a lower price, ask for either a price reduction OR add-ons (e.g., 6-month extension,
   new tyres, valet) — don’t ask for both.
5. **Offer to pay immediately** if they accept your price and will provide everything in writing (VIN, current mileage
   photo, and approved used certificate). Use bank transfer or card but confirm the deposit terms first.
6. **Be willing to walk** — best leverage you have. If they push “final offer”, say “no thanks” and leave. They often
   call back within 24 hrs.

# Specific tactics they may be using on you (and short counters)

* Price hike after interest = **demand testing**. Counter: “If you had demand you should have sold it; I want the
  earlier price.”
* Send video instead of documents = **stalling / impression management**. Counter: “Video is fine, but I require
  documents (DSB / MOT / VIN) before viewing.”
* “Arrived a week ago” = **fresh stock premium**. Counter: show comps for cars delivered recently and ask for price
  parity.
* “We can’t hold it without deposit” = **force decision**. Counter: ask for small refundable deposit or insist they hold
  for 24 hours.

# Legal & practical protections

* **Ask the dealer to email you the full purchase order and any warranty or promises** — don’t rely on verbal
  agreements.
* **Check deposit terms**: Card payments are best (easier to trace/chargeback) and deposits should be refundable if you
  withdraw within a reasonable window or if the dealer cannot prove the car condition.
* **If you buy online / distance sale**, you may have a 14-day cancellation right (distance contracts) — check the exact
  offer terms. If it’s in-person, there is usually no automatic cooling-off.
* **Use an independent inspection** (RAC, AA, or an independent Mercedes specialist) if you want absolute assurance —
  cost is small vs buying a bad car.

# Quick checklist to send them immediately (short & firm)

> Please send me before I view: VIN/build sheet, full Mercedes DSB or service invoices for 2021–2025, last three MOT
> certificates, Approved Used paperwork (warranty), and a dashboard photo showing mileage. I will only proceed after I
> have these.

If you want, I’ll:

* Draft a short email tailored to the dealer that calls out the price increase and requests the documents (I can include
  the exact reg and their showroom name).
* Or I can fetch 3 recent comparable Approved Used C200 AMG Line Edition Premium listings in your area so you have
  bargaining comparables ready.

Which one do you want me to do now?
