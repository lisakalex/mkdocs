# Used Car Purchase Checklist

## **1. Vehicle Identity & Paperwork**

* **V5C Logbook (Registration Certificate):** Ensure the seller’s name matches the registered keeper.
* **VIN (Vehicle Identification Number):** Confirm the VIN on the vehicle matches the one shown on the V5C.
* **MOT Certificate:** Check that it’s valid and consistent with the GOV.UK MOT record.
* **Service History:** Verify a full Mercedes-Benz digital record or stamped service book.
* **HPI / Finance Check:** Confirm there’s no outstanding finance, insurance write-off, or stolen status (use services
  such as **Experian**, **AA Car Check**, or **HPI Check**).
* **Sales Invoice / Receipt:** Must include seller’s name, address, vehicle details, agreed price, and warranty terms.

* **Interior:** Confirm seats, dashboard, infotainment, and switches are in good working order.

  unusual noises.
