# Dealers common tricks 1

## 1. **Why the Price Increased**

### a. **Dynamic (algorithmic) pricing**

Many main dealers now use pricing software like **Auto Trader Retail Accelerator**, **DealerSocket**, or **AutoSLR**
that automatically adjusts prices daily based on:

* Number of online views / “saved” vehicles.
* Average market price for similar cars.
* Supply in local radius.
* Time in stock (days since listed).

If their system detects **high interest (views or enquiries)**, it automatically **raises** the price slightly to test
the ceiling buyers will accept.
If a car sits unsold for weeks, it **drops** the price.
So, the jump from £22,318 to £22,652 is most likely an **algorithmic move** — not personal to you.

## 2. **Psychological or Negotiation-Based Reasons**

Sometimes the price change is **manual** — here’s why a salesperson might do it:

| Reason                                  | Explanation                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Create urgency**                      | If they think you’re interested but hesitating, increasing price subtly pressures you (“prices are rising — better buy soon”). |
| **Signal “market confidence”**          | Makes you think the car is in demand, preventing low offers.                                                                   |
| **Cover expected reconditioning costs** | If they just fitted tyres, serviced it, or added MOT, they might bump price to cover costs.                                    |
| **Manager’s quota**                     | Sometimes the used-car manager adjusts stock pricing weekly to meet margin targets.                                            |

## 3. **Tactics Dealers Commonly Use**

Here’s what’s happening behind the scenes at big “Approved Used” Mercedes sites:

| Tactic                          | What it looks like                                   | What it means for you                                                      |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **“Price drift”**               | Car goes up or down £100–£500 periodically           | Software is testing market. They’ll still negotiate if it doesn’t sell.    |
| **“Price reset” after contact** | You show interest → price rises slightly             | Creates impression of scarcity. They’re trying to make you commit faster.  |
| **“Hold price for 48h” offer**  | They say, “we’ll hold this price if you decide soon” | Common ploy — the price isn’t really about to rise further; it’s pressure. |
| **“Admin fee” or “prep fee”**   | Added at the end (£99–£199)                          | Negotiate to have this waived.                                             |
| **“Deposit to secure car”**     | They ask for £99–£250 refundable deposit             | Fine if refundable in writing; don’t pay if unclear.                       |

## 4. **How to Outsmart Their Tactics**

Here’s how you keep control and pay fair value:

1. **Keep records:**
   Screenshot every listing and price (dated). Dealers cannot justify arbitrary hikes if you have proof of the previous
   lower price.

2. **Use that to negotiate:**
   When speaking to them:

   > “I noticed your car (reg EF70UNZ) was £22,318 last week when we first spoke — I’m still interested, but at that
   market price level. Is that figure still possible?”

   Dealers know you’re tracking the market and will often “check with manager” then bring it back down.

3. **Wait 2–3 weeks:**
   If it doesn’t sell, the dynamic pricing software will drop the price again automatically.

4. **Compare with Auto Trader averages:**
   If others with same year/spec/mileage are £21k–£22k, use that data to argue “market price.”

5. **Look at “Days on Auto Trader”:**
   Most ads show “in stock for 10 days / 20 days.” After 21–30 days unsold, dealers almost always start dropping prices
   again.

## 5. **Summary: What’s Really Going On**

| Observation                 | Likely Cause                                        | What To Do                                        |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Price rose £334 in one week | Dynamic pricing algorithm or manual “scarcity” move | Don’t react; hold your offer at £22.3k or less    |
| Salesman sent a video       | You’re on their “hot lead” list                     | Expect follow-ups; wait 1–2 weeks and monitor     |
| Car is newly listed         | They’ll test high price for 10–14 days              | Be patient — the first drop is usually soon       |
| Approved Used label         | Adds perceived value / margin                       | You can still negotiate; they get margin headroom |

If you like, I can **monitor that specific car’s price** on Mercedes’ site for the next 2–3 weeks and tell you when it
drops again (that’s usually your buying window).
Would you like me to track it and alert you when the price changes next?
