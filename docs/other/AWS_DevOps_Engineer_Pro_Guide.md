Introduction

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment are two
important parts of DevOps. In this process, when commit or changes
happen in source code, they go through automated stage gates, all the way
from building, testing, deploying the applications from development to
production environments, across cloud accounts.

In this chapter, we learn how AWS CodeCommit makes it easy for
developers to collaborate on code using secure code repositories and AWS
CodeBuild compiles source code, runs tests and produces software
packages that are ready to deploy, on a dynamically created build server.

Creating a commit

We can use Git client, AWS CLI or CodeCommit Console to create a
commit in CodeCommit repository. In this example, we will show how to
commit using Git client which is the most preferred method used by the
developers to push the changes in AWS CodeCommit repository.

Use the following steps to commit a file in MyFirstRepo CodeCommit

Ensure you are on the right branch otherwise, run git branch which will
display the list of branches. If you are not in the right branch run git
checkout branch-name to switch to the intended branch.

Make a change to the branch like adding, updating, or deleting a file. For
example, create a test file with some text: Hello to DevOps

Run git status command and it will alert you that there are some untracked
files.

Run git add This command will include a change in the working directory
to the staging area.

If we run git it will alert that there are some changes to be committed.

Finally run git commit -m "Some comments to the If we run git status now
git will alert that commit is ready to be pushed from local repo to
CodeCommit repository.

If the changes in the file look good, then run git push origin remote-
branch which will push the file to CodeCommit repository

Security requirements for AWS CodeCommit repository

CodeCommit repositories are automatically encrypted at rest. No action is
needed from the customer in this regard. CodeCommit also encrypts data
in transit automatically. The first time we create a repository in
CodeCommit, CodeCommit creates an AWS-managed key
(aws/codecommit) in the same region and stores it in your AWS account.
CodeCommit uses this key to encrypt and decrypt the data in this and
other repositories in the same AWS account. Please note that we cannot
use a customer-managed key created in AWS KMS Service to encrypt or
decrypt data in CodeCommit repositories.

We are allowed to create our own custom IAM policies by allowing
permissions to CodeCommit actions and resources.

In this section, we will show how to create a Deny policy that prevents
users from making changes (Push/DeleteBranch/PutFileMerge) to a
particular branch named master in a repository By attaching the following
IAM policy, we can prevent the users from pushing any commit(s) to the
master branch.

Tagging repositories in CodeCommit

Tags are custom key-value pairs that are assigned to any AWS resource.
These are different from Git tags that are applied to any commit. For
example, we can use tag-resource AWS CLI to add a tag to the
CodeCommit repository.

1.  aws codecommit tag-resource --resource-arn arn:aws:codecommit:us-
east-1:111111111111:MyFirstRepo \

2.    --tags

If the command is successful, it will not return nothing as on output. You
can use list-tags-for-resource AWS CLI to return the tag which was added
earlier.

3.  aws codecommit list-tags-for-resource \

4.   –resource-arn arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-
1:111111111111:MyFirstRepo

The output will display the tags that have been added:

1.  {

2.   "tags": {

Setting up CodeCommit trigger for SNS topic

Using CodeCommit Triggers, we can capture certain events that occur in the
repository and launch an action in other AWS services.

In general, triggers are configured in CodeCommit to:
• Send emails to subscribed users when the developer pushes the code to the
repository

• Notify to external build system to start a build when a developer merges
code from one branch to another branch in CodeCommit repository

• Invoke an AWS lambda function

In this section, we will provide you with a step-by-step procedure using AWS
CLI commands to create a trigger for a CodeCommit repository so that events
in repository trigger notification from a SNS topic. The users who have
subscribed to that SNS topic are notified via an email about the creation of
new branches in the repository.

We have created two shell scripts to automate this entire process. The
architecture diagram of this example is illustrated in Figure

The first shell script create-repo-and-snstopic.sh creates a CodeCommit
repository and an SNS topic with email subscription.

7.  git push origin new_branch

Upon successful completion of preceding command, we will receive the
following email notification that new branch has been created successfully as
illustrated in Figure

Setting up CodeCommit trigger for Lambda function

We can also invoke lambda function for certain events which occur on AWS
CodeCommit repository. In this section, we will create a lambda function that
returns the commit ID of the push event to the AWS CloudWatch logs.

Follow the given steps to create AWS Lambda function from AWS Console:


Figure 1.7: AWS CodeCommit Integration with AWS Lambda

Sign-in to AWS Management Console and go to AWS Lambda Console.

On Lambda function page, choose Create On the Create function, choose
Author from In function name, provide a name for the function

On Configuration tab, choose Add

In Trigger choose CodeCommit from the services drop-down menu as shown
in the following screenshot:

1.  import json

2.  import os

3.  import boto3

4.  codecommit = boto3.client('codecommit')

5.  def lambda_handler(event, context):

6.     try:

7.          repo_name = event['Records'][0]['eventSourceARN'].split(':')[-1]

8.         commit_hash = event['Records'][0]['codecommit']['references'][0]
['commit']

9.         branchName = os.path.basename(

10.             str(event['Records'][0]['codecommit']['references'][0]['ref']))

11.         print("Commit hash is: " + commit_hash)

12.     except Exception as e:

13.         print(f"Error processing event: {e}")

Go to AWS CLI and clone the MyFirstRepo Repository and push an empty
file to the repository as shown below:


---

### Page 74

1.  git clone

2.  cd MyFirstRepo/

3.  touch newfile

4.  git add newfile

5.  git commit -m "added new file"

6.  git push origin test_branch

Go to AWS CloudWatch logs and check the timestamp of the log stream and
you will notice commit id of git push event in the logs. Refer to Figure

Creating a pull request in AWS CodeCommit

By creating a pull request, users can collaborate. They can review code,
provide comments, and merge changes from one branch to another. We
can also create approver rules for the pull request. For example, we can
create an approver rule where at least two users need to approve the pull
request before the code is merged from one branch to another. Now, we
will show you an example where we will create a pull request in an AWS
CodeCommit repository using AWS CLI.

In this section, we will provide you with two examples. In the first
example, Example-1 we create a pull request named My Test Pull Request
with a valid description that targets new_branch source branch and is to be
merged in the default branch in the AWS Code Repository named

Example 1:

1.  aws codecommit create-pull-request \

2.      --title "My Test Pull Request" \

3.      --description "Please review these changes by COB today" \

4.      --client-request-token testtoken١2٣ \

Creating an approver rule for pull request

In the next example, we will create an approver rule for pull request using
## AWS CLI.

To create the approver rule, first we need to find out how many pull
requests are currently OPEN by running the following AWS CLI:

1.  aws codecommit list-pull-requests --author-arn
arn:aws:iam::111111111111:user/testuser \

2.   --pull-request-status OPEN --repository-name MySecondRepo

Output:

1.  { [ "4", "3" ] }

Now, we pick one pull request ID and pass it to the next AWS CLI to
create an approver rule:

1.  aws codecommit create-pull-request-approval-rule  \

2.     --pull-request-id  4 \

Working with private NPM packages in CodeArtifact

AWS CodeArtifact fetches software packages on-demand from public
repositories such as npm registry, Maven central, Python Package Index and
NuGet. CodeArtifact securely publishes these private packages to a central
organizational repository and shares them across organizations. Automated
builds, such as CodeBuild pipelines, pull dependencies from CodeArtifact for
use and publish newer versions of the packages. We can also build automated
approval workflows for software releases using CodeArtifact APIs and gain
full visibility into the packages by integrating with AWS CloudTrail.

In this example, we will show how to create, publish, and download a private
npm package using AWS CodeArtifact. The architecture diagram of this
solution is shown in Figure


Figure 1.12: Publishing private npm packages with AWS CodeArtifact



---

### Page 87

To complete this use case in your AWS account, open the CloudShell terminal
and follow the step-by-step instructions below:

Create a new domain in CodeArtifact:

aws codeartifact create-domain --domain my-test-domain

Create a new CodeArtifact repository in the domain we just created:

aws codeartifact create-repository --domain my-test-domain --repository
my-test-repo

Log in to the CodeArtifact repository using the AWS CLI:

aws codeartifact login --tool npm --domain my-test-domain --repository my-
test-repo

This command will return a temporary authorization token and configure our
local npm to use the CodeArtifact repository. The token is valid for 12 hours.

Create a new directory for your package and navigate to it:

mkdir hello-world-package

cd hello-world-package

Initialize the package with npm init and the specified scope:

npm init --scope=@mycompany -y


---

### Page 88


This will create a package.json file in your package directory.

Create an index.js file in the package directory with the following content:

1.  function showGreeting() {

2.   console.log('Hello World, DevOps Gurus!');

3.  }

4.

5.  module.exports = showGreeting;

This file exports a simple function that displays Hello World, DevOps Gurus!
message.

Create a .npmrc file in the root directory of your npm package, if you do not
already have one, and add the following lines:

registry=https://my-test-domain-[your-aws-accountid].d.codeartifact.us-east-
1.amazonaws.com/npm/my-test-repo/

always-auth=true

Publish your npm package to the CodeArtifact repository:



---

### Page 89

npm publish

Figure the output after we published the package:


Figure Package Publication to CodeArtifact Repository

Now, if we navigate to the CodeArtifact console and check the repository, we
can see that our new package is ready to be downloaded, as shown in Figure

Automated code review with AWS CodeGuru

AWS CodeGuru is a developer tool that uses machine learning to improve
code quality and optimize application performance. It consists of two main
components: CodeGuru Reviewer and CodeGuru Profiler. CodeGuru
Reviewer scans code repositories, analyzing pull requests to find potential
issues, security vulnerabilities, and deviation from best practices. CodeGuru
Profiler, on the other hand, analyzes the runtime behavior of applications,
finding performance bottlenecks and suggesting optimizations to improve
efficiency and reduce infrastructure costs.

In this real-world example, a manager who acts as a code approver needs help
in setting up a tool for reviewing the codebase to check for any code issues
that may contribute to poor application performance. AWS CodeGuru will be
used to review the code for any potential bugs. As a DevOps engineer, we
will associate a CodeCommit repository with AWS CodeGuru Reviewer.
Whenever a pull request is created to merge the code from the development
branch to the main branch, CodeGuru Reviewer will automatically start
analyzing the code and provide recommendations. This process ensures that
the manager receives valuable insights into the code quality, enabling
informed decision-making before approving any changes.

The architecture diagram of this use-case is shown in Figure

Building and deploying source code with AWS CodeBuild and S3

In this example, we use AWS CodeBuild to build a collection of sample
source code build input files into a deployable version of build code artifact.
We are instructing CodeBuild to use Apache Maven which is a build tool for
Java applications. For this tutorial we do not need to be familiar with Maven
build tool. Figure 1.10 shows how AWS CodeBuild gets the source code from
S3, downloads source code into the build environment, uses build
specification to build the project and finally uploads the build output artifact
to S3. Build information is logged into AWS CloudWatch logs.




---

### Page 103

Figure 1.18: CodeBuild use S3 as input/output to get source code/produce
artifacts

Following is the step-by-step procedure that should be followed while using
AWS CodeBuild Service in this build process:

Creating source code files: Create a root project directory named
HelloWorldMavenTest and cd Under the directory create following files:

HelloWorld.java
1.  package helloworld;

2.  public class HelloWorld {

3.    public static void main(String[] args) {

4.    Greeteing greeting = new Greeteing();

5.          System.out.println(greeting.showMessage());

6.      }

7.  }

Greeting.java

1.  package helloworld;



---

### Page 104

2.  public class Greeting {

3.      public String showMessage() {

4.          return "Hello world!";

5.      }

6.  }

Creating buildspec A buildspec file is a collection of build commands in yaml
format that is used by AWS CodeBuild to run a build.

Create and place inside HelloWorldMavenTest subdirectory.
1.  version: 0.2

17.  artifacts:

18.    files:

19.      - target/helloWorldFromCodeBuild-1.0.jar

Creating two S3 Create two S3 buckets. One bucket will store the build input
and the other bucket stores the build output. These two buckets should be in
the same region where build exists.

Use following naming convention for creating input and output buckets.


---

### Page 108


Input bucket codebuild-[region]-[your-aws-accountid]-input-bucket

Output bucket codebuild-[region]-[your-aws-accountid]-output-bucket


Figure Input and Output Buckets

Uploading source code and buildspec file into input S3 bucket: Run the
following AWS CLI to package the files in a .zip format and upload the ZIP
file into input S3 bucket:
1.  zip -r HelloWorld.zip .

2.  aws s3 cp HelloWorld.zip s3://codebuild-us-east-1-111111111111-input-
bucket

Creating CodeBuild Create a build project that AWS CodeBuild uses to run
the build. A build project includes information on how to run a build, the path
where to get the source code, which commands to run and where to upload
the build output.

On Create build project page, enter the following information before you hit
on Create build
•  Project codebuilddemo-project

•  Source Amazon S3



---

### Page 109

Building and pushing Docker image to AWS ECR

In this example, we use AWS CodeBuild to produce a build output as Docker
image and push the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry image
repository.

Here, we use Node.js application into a Docker container. See below for a
step-by-step procedure to run this example on AWS account. The flowchart
representation of the process can be seen in the following figure:


Figure 1.25: Upload docker image to AWS ECR by CodeBuild

Create a private image repository in ECR. Ensure that ECR repository and
build environment are in the same AWS region. The name of the repository
should be the same as the value for environment variable
IMAGE_REPO_NAME which will be used in environment settings in
CodeBuild in subsequent steps.

Configure an App Runner service

AWS App Runner is a fully managed service designed to simply and
accelerate the deployment and scaling of containerized applications. App
Runner allows users to seamlessly deploy Docker images stored in ECR
repositories or build and deploy applications from source code repositories.
AWS App Runner is an ideal solution for deploying and managing
containerized applications on AWS with minimal effort and maintenance.

In this example, we will build upon the earlier section where we dockerized
a Node.js web application. The source code for the web application was
stored in an AWS CodeCommit repository, and we created a CodeBuild
project that pulled the source code from CodeCommit, built the Docker
image, and deployed it to ECR. In this section, we will use the uploaded
image in ECR from the earlier section and deploy it as an AWS App Runner
service, allowing us to manage quickly and efficiently the containerized
Node.js application on AWS.

The architecture diagram of this solution is shown in Figure

### Page 132


Figure 1.34: Create a source image repository service

To complete this use case in your AWS account, follow the step-by-step
instructions below:


---

### Page 133


Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the necessary permissions configured.
Creating an IAM role is the first step, allowing AWS App Runner to access
your AWS resources securely.

1. Create an IAM Role: Open a CloudShell session and save the following
script to a file named
1.  #!/bin/bash

2.

3.  # Create the trust relationship policy JSON file

4.  cat > trust_policy.json << EOL

5.  {

6.     "Version": "2012-10-17",

7.     "Statement": [

8.         {

9.             "Effect": "Allow",

10.             "Principal": {


---

### Page 134


11.                 "Service": "build.apprunner.amazonaws.com"

12.             },

13.             "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"

14.         }

15.     ]

16.  }

## 17.  EOL

18.

19.  # Create the IAM role with the specified trust relationship policy

20.  aws iam create-role --role-name AppRunnerECRAccessRole --assume-
role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json

21.

22.  # Attach the AWSAppRunnerServicePolicyForECRAccess managed
policy to the role



---

### Page 135

23.  aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name AppRunnerECRAccessRole --
policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-
role/AWSAppRunnerServicePolicyForECRAccess

24.

25.  # Remove the trust_policy.json file

26.  rm trust_policy.json

Run the script in the CloudShell terminal using:
1.  chmod +x create_apprunner_role.sh

2.  ./create_apprunner_role.sh

The preceding script creates an IAM role named AppRunnerECRAccessRole
that App Runner uses to access image in ECR repository.

2. Get ECR repository Run following command, which will output the
repository ARN that will be needed in the step when we create App Runner
Service:

1.  aws ecr describe-repositories \

2.   --repository-names nodejs-repo \

3.   --query 'repositories[0].repositoryArn' --output text

The output from the command above is as follows:



---

### Page 136

arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1: 111111111111:repository/nodejs-repo

3. Create App Runner Service: Prepare the following JSON file which will
serve as the input to the App Runner create-service CLI command. This
JSON specifies the name of the App Runner service, the source for deploying
the service (which is an image repository in our case), the image identifier,
the port where our application listens within the container (which is the type
of image repository (which is ECR in our case), a boolean flag for the auto
deployment option that indicates continuous integration from the source
repository (enabled in our case, meaning that repository change triggers a
deployment), and the Role ARN that grants the App runner service access to a
source repository.

Conclusion

In this chapter we learnt how to create a CodeCommit repository to store
the code and files securely for the project. We learnt the usage of different
CodeCommit CLI commands such as clone a repository, tag repository,
create pull request, list pull requests, creating an approval rule for pull
request by taking different examples. We took two real-word use-cases
and learnt how to create a CodeCommit trigger for AWS SNS topic and
AWS Lambda.

The other AWS Service which we learnt in this chapter is CodeBuild. As
an example, we took two use-cases. The first use-case CodeBuild takes
the source code of java application from S3 input bucket, builds the source
code using Maven build tool and uploads the build output to S3 output
bucket. In the second use-case we used CodeBuild to build a Node.js
application into a docker container, produce an image and upload it to
ECR repository.

Additionally, we explored the benefits of AWS CodeGuru, AWS App
Runner, AWS CloudShell, and AWS CodeArtifact, learning how to
integrate these services into our projects to enhance our DevOps
capabilities.

In the next chapter we will use CodeCommit when we build a CI/CD
pipeline using CodeCommit, CodePipeline to deploy static contents in S3
website. Also, the Docker image built by CodeBuild in this Chapter will

be used in Chapter Automation using OpsWorks and Elastic Beanstalk,
when we deploy the image to AWS ECS.

### Page 141


Points to remember

CodeCommit is highly available, scalable, and fault tolerant managed
service and integrates with other AWS Services such as CodeBuild,
CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, Lambda and SNS.

CodeCommit repositories are automatically encrypted at rest. It’s also
possible to encrypt repository data in transit using HTTPS and SSH
protocol.

By default, any CodeCommit repository has sufficient permissions to push
code to the repository. We must configure an IAM policy to limit pushes
and merges to a branch.

CodeBuild is a fully managed build service in AWS which compiles
source code, runs unit tests, and produces artifacts that are ready to
deploy.

We must provide CodeBuild with a build project. A build project contains
information from where to get the source code, which build environment
to use, which commands to run and where to store the build output.

CodeBuild is used in building pipeline for building output a Docker image
and then pushes the Docker image to AWS ECR image repository.

AWS CodeGuru is an intelligent code review service that helps improve
code quality by identifying hard-to-find issues and providing
recommendations. It can be integrated into your development workflow to
automate code reviews and enhance security and best practices.

AWS App Runner provides a fully managed service for building,
deploying, and scaling containerized applications quickly. It simplifies the
deployment process, allowing developers to focus on writing code and
reducing the complexity of infrastructure management.

AWS CloudShell is a browser-based shell that enables you to manage and
interact with your AWS resources directly from the AWS Management
Console. It comes pre-installed with the AWS CLI, SDKs, and other
essential tools, making it easier to perform DevOps tasks without the need
to set up a local environment.

AWS CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository service that
allows you to store, publish, and share software packages securely. It can
be used to manage private NPM packages and other package types,
simplifying dependency management and improving the reliability of your
build and deployment processes.

### Page 144


Answers

Run the following create-repository command specifying unique name for
the repository, an optional comment about repository and optional key-
value pair:

1. aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name \

2. my-repo --repository-description "repo name" --tags env=dev

AWS CodeBuild uses build specification (build spec) file to run a build
named as This file is in YAML format and is a collection of build
commands and related settings. This file is used as part of source code
when we create build project for the CodeBuild.

Install, build and post_build are the key phases defined in the
buildspec.yml file.

Adding tags to the repository can be done from both AWS console and
using AWS CLI. The syntax to add a tag using AWS CLI is as follows:

1. aws codecommit tag-resource \

2. --resource-arn arn:aws:codecommit:us-east-1:1111111111:my-repo \

3. --tags env=test,product=my-product

### Page 149


Introduction

In Chapter Continuous Integration with CodeCommit and we learnt how
AWS CodeCommit and AWS CodeBuild services work together and build
the artifacts which are tested and produce the software applications or
revisions that are ready to be deployed in AWS Cloud or on-premises
environment.

In the fast-paced world of software development, delivering high-quality
applications quickly and reliably is crucial for staying competitive.
Traditional software release cycles, characterized by infrequent and time-
consuming deployments, are no longer sufficient to meet the demands of
today’s dynamic market. This is where continuous delivery comes into
play.

Continuous delivery is a software development approach that emphasizes
frequent and automated releases of software to ensure rapid and reliable
delivery to end-users. It enables development teams to deliver new
features, bug fixes, and improvements in a streamlined and efficient
manner. By automating the entire release process, continuous delivery
eliminates many of the bottlenecks and challenges associated with
traditional manual deployments.

In this chapter, we will learn how AWS CodeDeploy automates the
software deployment to EC2 Instance and AWS Fargate Services. We will
also learn how to develop CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline which
orchestrates AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeDeploy

Services and produce fast and reliable application and infrastructure
software releases.


---

### Page 151


Structure

In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics about AWS
CodeDeploy:
• Deploy website to EC2 with CodeDeploy

• Blue/Green deployment to ECS with CodeDeploy

• CI/CD pipeline with CodePipeline for S3 website


---

### Page 152


Objectives

In this chapter, our practical approach focuses on achieving several
objectives. We will understand the concepts and principles behind AWS
CodeDeploy, its various deployment strategies, and how it simplifies the
software deployment process to EC2 instances and AWS Fargate services.
We will implement a blue/green deployment strategy using AWS
CodeDeploy to ensure zero downtime and seamless deployment to
Amazon ECS. Additionally, we will develop a CI/CD pipeline with AWS
CodePipeline for S3 websites, integrating AWS CodeCommit, AWS
CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy services to produce fast and reliable
application and infrastructure software releases.

Deploy website to EC2 with CodeDeploy

In this example, we will deploy a simple web application to EC2 instance
running on Amazon Linux using CodeDeploy. CodeDeploy takes the
source code from S3 bucket and deploys to EC2 instance and sends the
deployment status (Start/Success/Failure) to SNS topic as depicted in
Figure


Figure 2.1: Architecture diagram to deploy Simple website to EC2
Instance


---

### Page 154


Prerequisites

Before we deploy the code to EC2 instance, we must complete these steps:

Creating Service role for Service roles are used to grant permission to
AWS Services so that they can use other AWS resources. Copy the
following policy in a text file and save as

This role will grant permission to CodeDeploy for reading tags on EC2
instance and publish information to SNS topic:
1.  {

2.     "Version": "2012-10-17",

3.     "Statement": [

4.         {

5.             "Sid": "",

6.             "Effect": "Allow",

7.             "Principal": {

8.                 "Service": [



---

### Page 155

9.                     "codedeploy.amazonaws.com"

10.                 ]

11.             },

12.             "Action": "sts: AssumeRole"

13.         }

14.     ]

15.  }

Copy the following policy in a text file and save as This inline policy will
allow CodeDeploy Service role to send the deployment status to SNS
service:
1.  {

2.     "Version": "2012-10-17",

3.     "Statement": [

4.         {

5.             "Effect": "Allow",

6.             "Action": "sns:Publish",

7.             "Resource": "*"

8.         }

9.     ]

10.  }

Now, execute create-codedeploy-servicerole.sh bash script. The content in
this script creates a ServiceRole named

Note down the ARN of MyCodeDeployServiceRole from the output of the
script, this ARN will be used in creating deployment group later:
create-codedeploy-servicerole.sh

1.  #!/bin/sh

2.  aws iam create-role --role-name MyCodeDeployServiceRole --assume-

Creating an IAM instance profile: We need to create an instance profile
role and assign it to EC2 instance. This role grants permission to AWS S3
where our application is stored.

Create a text file and copy the following policy and save it into
codedeploy-ec2-trust.json file. The following policy will allow EC2 to
work on our behalf:
1.  {

2.     "Version": "2012-10-17",

3.     "Statement": [

4.         {

5.             "Sid": "",



---

### Page 159

6.             "Effect": "Allow",

7.             "Principal": {

8.                 "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"

9.             },

10.             "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"

11.         }

12.     ]

13.  }

Create another text file and copy the following policy and save into
1.  {

2.     "Version": "2012-10-17",

3.     "Statement": [

4.         {

5.             "Action": [



---

### Page 160

6.                 "s3:Get*",

7.                 "s3:List*"

8.             ],

9.             "Effect": "Allow",

10.             "Resource": "*"

11.         }

12.     ]

13.  }

Now, run the following bash script which creates an Instance profile role
named
create-ec2-instance-profile.sh

1.  #!/bin/sh

2.  aws iam create-role --role-name codedeploy-ec2-inst-profile --assume-
role-policy-document file://codedeploy-ec2-trust.json

3.  aws iam put-role-policy --role-name codedeploy-ec2-inst-profile  --
policy-name codedeploy-s3-permission --policy-document


---

### Page 161

file://codedeploy-s3-permission.json

4.  aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name codedeploy-
ec2-inst-profile

5.  aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name
codedeploy-ec2-inst-profile --role-name codedeploy-ec2-inst-profile

Now, all the prerequisites are completed so it is time to deploy the code to
EC2 Instance.


---

### Page 162


Deploy the code to EC2 instance

Follow these steps to deploy the code to EC2 instance:

SNS We will be using SNS Topic - my-sns-topic which was created in
Chapter Continuous Integration with CodeCommit and CodeBuild using
create-repo-and-snstopic.sh bash script. This topic is subscribed to a specified
email address ensuring that user receives an email notification when the build
is successful or fails, as shown in the following screenshot:


Figure 2.2: SNS subscription to receive build notification


---

### Page 163


Provision an AWS EC2 instance

The steps to provision an AWS EC2 instance are as follows:

Execute CLI to provision an EC2 instance. Before we run this command, we
need to prepare some parameters that will be supplied to run-instances
command:

Use ami-09d3b3274b6c5d4aa for ec2-ami-id as parameter which is the
Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID of the instance, refer to use AWS link at
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/finding-an-
ami.html to use alternate AMIs.

Use ec2-instance-type as a parameter, which is the name of the type of the
instance, refer to the link at https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types to use
alternate instance type.

Use ec2-key-name as a parameter which is the name of the EC2 instance key
pair that will be used to SSH access to instance.

codedeploy-ec2-inst-profile is the name of the IAM instance profile role
which was created in prerequisite #2. This role will be attached to the EC2
instance that will grant necessary permission to EC2 for accessing the S3
bucket where source code and website configuration exist.

Now, run-instances command with the above parameters to provision an EC2
instance:


---

### Page 164

1.  aws ec2 run-instances \

2.   --image-id ec2-ami-id \

3.   --key-name ec2-key-name \

4.   --count 1 \

5.   --instance-type ec2-instance-type \

6.   --iam-instance-profile Name=codedeploy-ec2-inst-profile

Figure the launched EC2 instance running in us-east-1b availability zone:


Figure is the computing platform where CodeDeploy will do the deployment

Adding HTTP Inbound Rule in Security Group: By default, a SSH rule is
added to the security group attached to the EC2 instance. Add one more rule,
that is, HTTP rule so that website can be viewed on the browser at port

## HTTP

## TCP



---

### Page 165

Port 80

0.0.0.0/0

Tagging an EC2 instance: Run the following command to tag the EC2
instance so that AWS CodeDeploy can identify this instance later during the
deployment:

aws ec2 create-tags --resources i-048792de47ca87eb9 --tags
Key=Name,Value=MyCodeDeployTest

Figure that instance has been tagged with the key-value pairs provided in the
above command:


Figure HTTP Inbound Rule to EC2 Instance

Installing CodeDeploy agent: It is essential to install CodeDeploy agent on
EC2 before deploying the code. If it is not installed, run the following shell
script to install it on the EC2 instance. This script can also be added in the
User Data field during the launch of the EC2 instance.
1.  #!/bin/sh

2.

3.  # Shell Script to Install CodeDeploy agent on Amazon Linux OS


---

### Page 166


4.  sudo yum update

5.  sudo yum install ruby

6.  sudo yum install wget

7.  cd /home/ec2-user

8.  wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.us-east-
1.amazonaws.com/latest/install

9.  chmod +x ./install

10.  sudo ./install auto

11.

12.  # Check if agent is running

13.  sudo service codedeploy-agent status

If the script ran successfully, we will be able to see the following output on
the screen with Process Identification Number

The AWS CodeDeploy agent is running as PID 1967.

### Page 167

Creating a S3 Bucket to upload website Use the following command to create
a S3 bucket where we will upload the application code so that CodeDeploy
knows from which location it must find the code revision and deploy into
EC2 instance:

aws s3 mb s3://simple-codedeploy-website

Also, add the following bucket policy to the above created bucket so that it
grants permission to EC2 to download the files during the deployment. The
value for Principal will be ARN for IAM instance profile:
1.  {

2.     "Statement": [

3.         {

4.             "Action": [

5.                 "s3:Get*",

6.                 "s3:List*"

7.             ],

8.             "Effect": "Allow",

9.             "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::simple-codedeploy-website/*",

10.             "Principal": {

12.             "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/MyCodeDeployServiceRole"

13.                 ]

14.             }

15.         }

16.     ]

Preparing Configuration files and website source contents: In this step,
prepare the configuration files for the website deployment, bundle them, and
upload them to S3 bucket. Create the following folder structure on our local
development environment and add the files as shown in the following code:
1.   |--Website/

2.       |-- appspec.yml

3.       |-- scripts/

4.       |    |-- install_web_server.sh

Figure 2.5: Registered simple-website-app application in CodeDeploy

Run the following command that will package all the local files from the
current directory in your development machine and upload it to the S3 bucket
(simple-codedeploy-website) in the compressed format (.zip):
1.  aws deploy push \

2.     --application-name simple-website-app \

3.     --s3-location s3://simple-codedeploy-website/simple-website-app.zip \

4.     --ignore-hidden-files

In the following figure, we can see that the bundled source code is uploaded
to the AWS S3 bucket and ready to be deployed in the next step:


Figure (.zip) website application is uploaded to S3 bucket



---

### Page 173

Deploying website application with CodeDeploy: To deploy the application
revision from S3 bucket, CodeDeploy needs a deployment group. We will use
the create-deployment-group AWS CLI to create deployment group. First,
prepare deployment-group-config.json JSON file which will be used as input
to create deployment group. In this file, we specify primarily the name of
application, that is, deployment group name, that is, tags assigned to EC2
Instance, CodeDeploy ServiceRole ARN, deployment configuration type and
name of SNS topic ARN.

Blue/Green deployment to ECS with CodeDeploy

As we know already, in the Blue/Green deployment strategy, we create two
environments, environment-1 (blue) which runs the current version of
application/software and environment-2 (green) which runs the newer version
of the application/software. This strategy increases the availability of
applications since one environment will always be available and in case the
deployment fails due to some reason, it is easy to roll back to the earlier
version of application/software by switching the production traffic.

In this example, we learn how AWS CodeDeploy Service deploys latest
version of application (Green) into ECS Service without any downtime.
During the deployment, CodeDeploy service will use an application load
balancer which is configured with two target groups and one production
listener. Figure 2.12 shows how the application load are integrated with
Target groups, ECS task sets before the deployment:



---

### Page 179


Figure 2.12: Original ECS task set before the deployment

Figure 2.13 shows how the production traffic will be switched back from
production listener to new replacement task set and original task set will be
terminated:

The architecture shown in Figure 2.14 depicts the complete flow on how
AWS CodeDeploy interacts with other AWS Services and performs
Blue/Green deployment in ECS service which is running on ECS Fargate
Cluster:

Prerequisites

Before we start the Blue-Green deployment using AWS CodeDeploy, we
must complete the following steps:

Service Role for Execute the following bash script that creates service role for
CodeDeploy to perform an ECS blue/green deployment on our behalf and
access other support services such as S3 and lambda.

ecs-codedeploy-role.sh
1.  #!/bin/sh

2.  aws iam create-role --role-name ecsCodeDeployRole --assume-role-
policy-document file://ecs-codedeploy-role-trust.json

3.  aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name ecsCodeDeployRole --policy-arn
arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSCodeDeployRoleForECS

4.  aws iam get-role --role-name ecsCodeDeployRole --query "Role.Arn" --
output text

Here, we have the JSON file which is supplied to AWS CLI in preceding bash
script:

ecs-codedeploy-role-trust.json
1.  {

2.     "Version": "2012-10-17",

automatically deploys the latest version of the application (green) using
CodeDeploy.

Before we start the deployment, we need to prepare a few JSON and YAML
files which are supplied to the AWS CLI command.

In this file, we specify CodeDeploy application name, deployment group
name, deployment type, that is, target group 1 and 2 names, production
listener Arn, ECS Service name, ECS cluster name and service role for
CodeDeploy to perform blue green deployment:

CI/CD Pipeline with CodePipeline for S3 Website

In this example, we will learn how to setup a CI/CD pipeline using
CodePipeline Service. We will be using AWS CodeCommit in source stage
and AWS S3 as a deployment action provider in our deployment stage.
Whenever a new static content is pushed to CodeCommit repository by the
user the pipeline is triggered automatically, and the latest code is deployed to
S3 bucket for Static Website.

Figure 2.22 shows the architecture diagram of deploying static content to S3
bucket by AWS CodePipeline:

By now, we have created a pipeline with two actions. A source stage with
AWS CodeCommit action where static files for website are added. A
deployment stage with AWS S3 deployment action. Every time we change or
add website files in CodeCommit repository, CodePipeline triggers the
deployment and latest files are uploaded to S3 website.

Conclusion

In this chapter, we learnt how to deploy a simple web application to EC2
instance using AWS CodeDeploy service. We launched an EC2 instance
and added an inbound security group to allow HTTP connection. We
prepared source code files, scripts and AppSpec file and uploaded to S3
bucket from which CodeDeploy can deploy it. We created the deployment
group configuration file and triggered CodeDeploy deployment using
create-deployment command using AWS CLI. We also learnt about Blue-
green deployment in ECS using AWS CodeDeploy that enables to deploy
new versions of application to a separate environment called green and
perform testing before switching traffic from the old environment to the
new one.

The other AWS service which we learnt in this chapter is AWS
CodePipeline. We configured a pipeline using the CodePipeline service.
This pipeline continuously delivers static files to S3 from CodeCommit
repository. Pipeline automatically detects the changes in repository and
pushes the latest files to S3 bucket.

In the next Chapter, Infrastructure as Code using CloudFormation, we will
create a continuous pipeline to deploy CloudFormation Stacks. The
pipeline builds static website that is hosted on AWS S3 and is served by
AWS Content Delivery Network AWS CloudFront Service.

Points to remember

AWS CodeDeploy uses Service Role to grant permission to other AWS
services for accessing AWS resources. CodeDeploy uses this IAM role to
read tags applied on EC2 instances so that it can identify to which it can
deploy applications.

There are three computing platforms on which CodeDeploy deploys an
application. These three platforms are EC2/On-Premises, AWS Lambda
and AWS ECS.

CodeDeploy supports both in-place and blue/green deployment types on
the computing platforms provided above.

CodeDeploy supports Canary, Linear and All-at-once deployment
configurations. These deployment configurations specify how the traffic is
routed during the deployments on the computing platforms provided in
second point.

CodeDeploy is used to perform blue/green deployment in ECS, allows to
release new version of containerized application with zero downtime. This
method involves deploying the new version of the application to new set
of containers, test the newer version, and then redirect the traffic to new
containers once they are ready. CodeDeploy makes it easy to roll back to
the old version in case test results are not satisfactory with newer version.


---

### Page 230


AWS CodePipeline can be used to continuously deliver files using S3 as
deployment provider in the deployment stage. Whenever CodePipeline
detects any changes in CodeCommit repository, which is configured as
source provider in the source stage of pipeline, CodePipeline will deploy
the files to S3 bucket.

EC2 Image Builder is a service that simplifies the creation and
maintenance of custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). It allows you to
automate the process of building and testing your images, ensuring they
are always up-to-date and secure.

Questions

What is the name of the configuration file used by CodeDeploy to manage
the deployments?

What’s the purpose of CodeDeploy agent?

Which deployment strategy is used in AWS CodeDeploy that minimizes
the risk of failed deployments?

What are the stages in AWS CodePipeline, and how they can be used to
orchestrate software delivery pipeline?

What are the artifacts in AWS CodePipeline, and how can they be used to
manage your application’s deployment packages?


---

### Page 232


Answers

CodeDeploy uses application specification file (AppSpec) configuration to
manage the deployments on different compute platforms provided in
second point. This file is a YAML or JSON formatted, and it is bundled
together with the content to deploy into an archive file (zip or tar).

CodeDeploy agent is a software component which is used to facilitate
deployments to EC2 instances, on-premises instances. The agent is not
needed for the deployments on Lambda and ECS computing platforms.

Canary deployment in CodeDeploy helps to minimize the risk of failed
deployment by testing newer version of application on small scale before
it’s rolled out to the entire infrastructure. This strategy enables us to catch
potential issues in early stage and take a corrective action, ensuring a
successful deployment.

Stages are used in CodePipeline to define different phases of software
delivery process, such as build, test, and deploy. Within each stage, we can
specify the actions that should be performed, such as compiling the code,
running unit tests, and deploying the application. We can also specify the
order in which these actions should be executed in parallel or sequentially.

Artifacts are used in CodePipeline to manage application’s deployment
packages, which is a collection of source code, configuration files, and


---

### Page 233

dependencies. Artifacts are stored and managed in S3, and they are used
by deployment services such as AWS CodeDeploy.

Introduction

In the previous chapter, we learned how AWS CodeDeploy automates the
software deployment to EC2 Instances and AWS Fargate Services. We
also explored the development of Continuous Integration and Delivery
pipelines using AWS CodePipeline, which orchestrates AWS
CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeDeploy Services, to
produce fast and reliable applications and infrastructure software releases.

In this chapter, we will cover three essential topics: building a golden
image using EC2 Image Builder, automating unit tests and code coverage
with AWS CodeBuild and Codecov, and constructing a cross-account
CI/CD pipeline. These topics will enhance your understanding of CI/CD
pipelines and modern DevOps practices, helping you to effectively
implement pipelines and deployment strategies across various
environments, ensuring thorough testing and improved production quality.


---

### Page 236


Structure

In this chapter, we will discuss following topics:
• Building a cross-account CI/CD pipeline

• Automating unit tests and code coverage

• Building golden image using EC2 Image Builder


---

### Page 237


Objectives

In this chapter, our practical approach revolves around several objectives
related to utilizing AWS services effectively. We will guide you through
building golden images with EC2 Image Builder, simplifying the creation
and management of Amazon Machine Images Next, we will demonstrate
automating unit tests and code coverage analysis using AWS CodeBuild
and Codecov, which will improve code quality and ensure our application
meets the necessary standards before deployment. Lastly, we will
construct a cross-account CI/CD pipeline, showcasing how AWS services
can be employed in a multi-account setup to bolster security and
streamline deployment processes across distinct environments.

By the end of this chapter, you will have hands-on experience in creating
golden images using EC2 Image Builder, automating unit tests and code
coverage analysis, and establishing a cross-account CI/CD pipeline. This
practical knowledge will enable you to harness various AWS services to
enhance your software deployment process, maintain high code quality,
and strengthen security in a multi-account AWS environment.

### Page 238


Building a cross-account CI/CD pipeline

Implementing a multi-account pipeline is an essential aspect of modern
DevOps practices, as it ensures that features are extensively tested in
dedicated environments before being made available to users. This helps
reduce errors and improve the overall quality of the production environment.
Additionally, by isolating each stage in separate accounts, we can apply
proper security measures tailored to each environment. This not only provides
enhanced access control for each account but also ensures that the database
and other resources are protected according to their specific requirements.
This multi-layered security approach helps safeguard your infrastructure and
data against unauthorized access and potential breaches.

For the purpose of demonstrating a multi-account example and to keep it
simple, we are using two AWS accounts: development and test - and
deploying a resource, an S3 bucket. However, this example can be extended
to more complex scenarios and additional accounts as needed. In this section,
we will be setting up a cross-account CI/CD pipeline using AWS
CodePipeline, Amazon S3, and AWS CloudFormation. The pipeline will fetch
the code from S3 bucket and deploy the code in both Dev and Test accounts.
The goal is to automate the process of deploying an S3 bucket resource in
both the development and test accounts.

The figure illustrating our cross-account CI/CD pipeline setup is shown
below in Figure



---

### Page 239


Figure 3.1: Cross-Account CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

Follow the step-by-step instructions below to complete this use-case on your
AWS account.

Prerequisites:
• Two AWS accounts: You will need to both a dev and test AWS accounts,
ensuring that you have the necessary permissions to manage resources in
each.

• CodePipeline service role: Reuse the existing service role, named
AWSCodePipelineServiceRole-us-east-1-s3website-codepipeline, previously
created in the CI/CD Pipeline with CodePipeline for S3 section of the last
chapter, Continuous Delivery with Code Deploy and CodePipeline.

Automating unit tests and code coverage

In this example, we will learn how to integrate AWS CodeBuild with
Codecov for automating unit tests and code coverage. Codecov is a code
coverage analysis and reporting tool that measures the test coverage of our
code. It identifies the methods and statements in the code that are not
tested and provides the results to determine where we should write tests to
improve the quality of code.

Here are the step-by-step instructions to complete this integration in your
AWS account:

Build golden image using EC2 Image Builder

In this example, we will walk through the process of creating a custom
Amazon EC2 image with an Apache web server using AWS Image Builder
and CloudShell. We will start by creating an EC2 Image Builder component
that installs and configures the Apache web server. Next, we will create an
image recipe that combines the component with a base Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
Next, we will set up an infrastructure configuration, which defines the
instance settings, and an image pipeline to automate the image building
process. After the custom image is built, we test it by launching an EC2
instance and verifying that the Apache web server is installed and running.

It is essential to become familiar with the basic concepts of Image Builder
before we create an EC2 Golden image. The main terms used in this process
include:
• Image This is the primary component in EC2 Image builder. A pipeline must
have at least one Image Recipe and an Infrastructure configuration.

• Image This is a versioned resource that contains a parent image and one or
more Components to build the image.

• This building component is consumed by the image recipe, such as
packages for installations.

• Infrastructure This configuration defines the environment in which our
image will be built and tested.



---

### Page 277

• Distribution This configuration defines how to share an image, such as
sharing it with selected AWS regions, accounts, or organizations.

Figure 3.12 illustrates the concepts and terms discussed above:


Figure 3.12: Overview of EC2 Image Builder concepts and components

To complete this use case in your AWS account, open the CloudShell terminal
and follow the step-by-step instructions below.

Prerequisites:
• Create an IAM role: Run the following script to create an IAM role and
instance profile for EC2 Image Builder:

1.  #!/bin/bash

2.  # Create the trust relationship policy JSON file

3.  cat > trust_policy.json << EOL

18.  # Create the IAM role with the specified trust relationship policy

19.  aws iam create-role --role-name EC2LinuxImageBuildRole --assume-
role-policy-document file://trust_policy.json

20.

21.  # Attach the EC2InstanceProfileForImageBuilder  managed policy to the
role

22.  aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name EC2LinuxImageBuildRole --
policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/EC2InstanceProfileForImageBuilder

This script creates a role named EC2LinuxImageBuildRole with the
necessary permissions. The full script, named can be found in the GitHub
repository associated in this chapter.

After fulfilling these prerequisites, proceed with the following steps:

Create an S3 First, let us create an S3 bucket in us-east-1 region to store the
Image Builder components and recipes by running command:
1.  aws s3api create-bucket --bucket my-ec2-image-builder-bucket \

2.   --region us-east-1

Replace my-image-builder-bucket with a unique name for your bucket.



---

### Page 280

Create an EC2 Image Builder In this step, we will create a component to
build, validate, test, and assess our image. The component is based on a
YAML document named The contents of YAML files are as follows:
1.  name: InstallApache

2.  description: Install and configure Apache web server

3.  schemaVersion: 1.0

4.

5.  phases:

6.   - name: build

7.     steps:

8.       - name: InstallApache

9.         action: ExecuteBash

10.         inputs:

11.           commands:

12.             - |

13.               #!/bin/bash



---

### Page 281

14.               sudo yum update -y

15.               sudo yum install -y httpd

16.               sudo systemctl enable httpd

17.               sudo systemctl start httpd

Run the following command to upload this YAML file to the S3 bucket:
1.  aws s3 cp install-apache.yml \

2.   s3://my-ec2-image-builder-bucket/components/install-apache.yml

Finally, execute the following command to create the Image Builder
component:
1.  aws imagebuilder create-component --cli-input-json '{

2.   "name": "InstallApache",

3.   "semanticVersion": "1.0.0",

4.   "changeDescription": "Initial version",

5.   "platform": "Linux",

6.   "uri": "s3://my-ec2-image-builder-bucket/components/install-apache.yml"

7.  }'


---

### Page 282


After completing these steps, we will have created a component named
InstallApache as shown in Figure We can view this component by navigating
to the EC2 Image Builder console and selecting Components under Saved
configurations on the left:


Figure 3.13: InstallApache Component in EC2 Image Builder Console

Note down the ARN of this component, as it will be used in next step when
we create an image:
1.  arn:aws:imagebuilder:us-east-
1:111111111111:component/installapache/1.0.0

Important: Throughout this section, ensure to replace 111111111111 with your
actual AWS account ID in all commands, scripts, and JSON configurations.
Failing to do this may result in unexpected behaviors.

Create an image recipe: In this step, we will create an image recipe that
utilizes the Amazon Linux 2 base image and includes the InstallApache

component created in previous step. First, run the following command to find
the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI ID in the us-east-1 region:
1.  aws ec2 describe-images \

2.   --region us-east-1 \

3.   --owners amazon \

4.   --filters 'Name=name,Values=amzn2-ami-hvm-2.0.????????.?-x86_64-
gp2' 'Name=state,Values=available' \

5.   --query 'sort_by(Images, &CreationDate)[-1].ImageId' \

6.   --output text

This command will return an AMI ID, which we will use in the next step. Let
us assume that the AMI ID is:
1.  ami-05f408238af346b4f

Now, create a JSON template named create-my-image-recipe.json and copy
following contents into it:
1.  {

2.     "name": "MyTestRecipe",

3.     "description": "This example image recipe creates a Linux image.",

4.     "semanticVersion": "1.0.0",

10.     ],

11.     "parentImage": "ami-05f408238af346b4f"

12.  }

Finally, run the following command to create an image recipe using the JSON
file:
1.  aws imagebuilder create-image-recipe \

2.     --cli-input-json file://create-my-image-recipe.json

This command should create an image pipeline named
ApacheWebServerPipeline using the specified image recipe and infrastructure
configuration. Figure the created image recipe:

Create an infrastructure configuration: Create an infrastructure configuration
that defines the instance type and other settings for the build environment:
1.  aws imagebuilder create-infrastructure-configuration --name
"ApacheWebServerInfraConfig" --instance-types "t2.micro" --instance-
profile-name "EC2InstanceProfileForImageBuilder" --logging '{

11.             }

12.         }

13.     ]

14.  }

Run the following command to create a distribution configuration using the
JSON provided above:
1.  aws imagebuilder create-distribution-configuration \

2.     --cli-input-json file://create-my-distribution-configuration.json

This configuration will share the image with our account, which is in us-east-

Conclusion

In this chapter, we learned how to use EC2 Image Builder to automate the
creation and maintenance of custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs),
ensuring a secure and up-to-date base for your infrastructure. Additionally,
we demonstrated how to integrate AWS CodeBuild with Codecov for
automating unit tests and code coverage, providing insights into the
quality of your code.

Lastly, we delved into building a cross-account CI/CD pipeline, which
allows for efficient collaboration and resource separation across multiple
AWS accounts, enhancing security measures and enabling consistent
deployment practices.

In the next chapter, Infrastructure as Code using we will create a
continuous pipeline to deploy CloudFormation Stacks. The pipeline builds
static website that is hosted on AWS S3 and is served by AWS Content
Delivery Network AWS CloudFront Service.

Points to remember

EC2 Image Builder is a service that simplifies the creation and
maintenance of custom Amazon Machine Images It allows you to
automate the process of building and testing your images, ensuring they
are always up-to-date and secure.

When using EC2 Image Builder, you’ll create components, image recipes,
infrastructure configurations, and distribution settings. These elements
work together in an image pipeline to automate the process of building,
testing, and sharing custom AMIs.

By setting up a cross-account CI/CD pipeline, teams can work across
different AWS accounts, enabling better collaboration and resource
separation. This setup helps in maintaining a clean separation of concerns
and enhances security and compliance practices.

The cross-account CI/CD pipeline enables a centralized approach to
manage and control the software development and deployment processes.
This helps in streamlining development efforts, improving resource
management, and ensuring consistent deployment practices across
multiple accounts.

By combining AWS CodeBuild and Codecov, you can automate the
process of running unit tests and reporting code coverage for your
projects. This integration streamlines your testing workflow and helps you

Questions

What is the role of a component in EC2 Image Builder?

How does Codecov improve testing workflow?

What is a key advantage of a cross-account CI/CD pipeline?


---

### Page 298


Answers

Components in EC2 Image Builder are used for software installation and
configuration, which are combined with a base AMI in an image recipe.

Codecov measures test coverage, identifies untested code, and provides
insights on where to write tests, improving code quality and application
reliability.

A cross-account CI/CD pipeline enhances security by isolating each stage
in separate accounts, enabling better access control and resource
protection.

Infrastructure as Code Using CloudFormation

### Page 300


Introduction

With AWS CloudFormation we can code our infrastructure from scratch
using CloudFormation template language written in JSON or YAML
format. Using templates, we can describe AWS resources and their
properties to be created. Templates can be saved locally or in an S3
bucket. CloudFormation manages related resources as a single unit called
a stack. We can create, update, and remove a collection of resources by
creating, updating, and deleting a stack. We can update the stack either by
a direct update or change the set. Change set is recommended in
production because using change set CloudFormation gives us to review
the changes before updating the resources.


---

### Page 301


Structure

This chapter will cover the following topics about the CloudFormation
service:

• CloudFormation nested stacks pipeline

• Lambda-backed custom resource deployment

• Differences between WaitCondition and CreationPolicy

• Cross stack references

• CloudFormation stack updates

• Drift detection and remediation


---

### Page 302


Objectives

The objective of this chapter is to provide a practical understanding of
Infrastructure as Code using AWS CloudFormation, enabling you to
efficiently create, manage, and update the infrastructure in AWS. By
exploring various features and techniques, such as nested stacks, Lambda-
backed custom resource deployment, differences between CreationPolicy
and cross stack references, stack updates, and drift detection and
remediation, you will be equipped with the knowledge to apply best
practices for maintaining robust and scalable infrastructure using
CloudFormation.

### Page 303


CloudFormation nested stacks pipeline

AWS CodePipeline has built-in integration with AWS CloudFormation.
Within a pipeline we can specify CloudFormation specific actions such as
creating/updating/deleting stack. In this example, we will build a pipeline that
builds a static website that is hosted on AWS S3, and AWS CloudFront serves
the website. AWS CloudFront is Amazon Content Delivery Network which
speeds up the delivery of website content (for example, images, style sheets,
JavaScript, and so on).

The architecture diagram for this use case is shown in Figure


Figure 4.1: Continuous delivery pipeline to deploy CloudFormation Nested
Stacks



---

### Page 304

The pipeline is separated into two stages:

The first stage of the pipeline retrieves source artifacts from AWS S3, and
source artifact contains CloudFormation templates and associated
configurations files.

The second stage of the pipeline deploys creates a CloudFormation parent
stack and two nested child CloudFormation stacks.

The hierarchy of these stacks is shown in Figure


Figure 4.2: Parent and child stacks relationship


---

### Page 305


Prerequisites

Follow the step-by-step instructions to implement this use case on your
personal AWS account. The following steps involve creating an S3 bucket for
artifacts, establishing a CloudFormation service role, and preparing source
files for deployment.

Create an S3 bucket to upload Use AWS CLI to create an S3 bucket in the us-
east-1 region. We will use this S3 bucket as a source repository, and
CodePipeline requires source files to be zipped before uploading to this
bucket.
1.  aws s3api create-bucket \

2.   --bucket cfn-deploy-s3-YOUR_UNIQUE_IDENTIFIER \

3.   --region us-east-1

us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-
1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-
east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1
us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-
1 us-east-1 us-east-1 us-east-1

After you have created your S3 bucket, you should verify its successful
creation configuration. Compare the output with the screenshot provided
below in Figure 4.3 to ensure that your bucket details are correct:

10.             "Resource": "*"

11.         }

12.     ]

13.  }

Please copy the following policy in a text file and save it as changeset-
permission-policy.json within a config subdirectory of your current working
directory. This inline policy will allow the CloudFormation service role to
create a change set for creating CloudFormation stacks:
1.  {

Now, you will need to execute create-cfn-servicerole.sh bash script, which is
responsible for creating the ServiceRole named Note down the ARN of this
role from the output of this script, as this ARN will be required later when
adding the deploy stage in CodePipeline.

Create the bash script within the scripts subdirectory of your current working
directory with the following content:

scripts/create-cfn-servicerole.sh
1.  #!/bin/sh

2.

3.  # Create a new IAM role for CloudFormation service with a trust
relationship defined in a local JSON file.

4.  aws iam create-role --role-name MyCloudFormationServiceRole --

Now that all the prerequisites are completed, it is time to configure the
continuous pipeline AWS CodePipeline.

Prepare the source files for the Before we can launch the continuous
deployment pipeline using AWS CodePipeline, it is essential to have our
CloudFormation templates ready for use. The parent stack CloudFormation
template will be orchestrating the creation of two nested stacks: one for the
S3 bucket and one for the CloudFront distribution The nested stack templates
need to be accessible in an S3 bucket, and their URLs are specified in the
TemplateURL property within the parent stack template.

Navigate to the templates subdirectory in your project. If it does not exist,
create it using the following commands:
1.  mkdir -p templates

2.  cd templates

Create the parent stack template file named with the following content:
1.  AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09

2.  Description: This parent stack creates S3 bucket and Cloudfront
Distribution

Lambda-backed custom resource deployment

Sometimes, we want to extend AWS CloudFormation to support more
resources, and non-supported AWS services, in such situations custom
resources come to the rescue. With custom resources, we can write custom
provisioning logic in templates that CloudFormation runs while creating,
updating, or deleting a stack. There are two types of custom resources:
AWS SNS backend and Lambda-backed.

Once we create an S3 bucket with a name, anyone can create a bucket
with the same name in any other region or account, once we delete that
bucket. This means S3 bucket names are globally unique and the
namespace is shared by all AWS accounts.

In this example, we use Lambda-backed resources to create an S3 bucket
with unique names. Figure 4.12 shows the complete workflow for
CloudFormation custom resource deployment by AWS Lambda-backed:



---

### Page 333


Figure 4.12: Architecture diagram for AWS Lambda-backed
CloudFormation custom resource deployment

Before we get started, let’s ensure we have everything set up correctly.
We’ll go through creating a CloudFormation template, setting up the
stack, and validating the process. Follow these steps to implement the use
case in your AWS account efficiently:

### Page 334


Create CloudFormation template

Let us review this CloudFormation template. This template takes
BucketName as input parameter and creates a custom resource type
named Custom::RandomNumberGenerator to invoke and send input
values to Lambda function named The lambda function uses that
information, creates unique ID, and sends a response to the pre-signed
URL. After AWS CloudFormation receives a pre-signed URL response,
creates a stack.

Differences between WaitCondition and CreationPolicy

Both CreationPolicy and WaitCondition are used to delay the creation of
the CloudFormation stack. WaitCondition is a CloudFormation resource.
While CreationPolicy is an attribute associated with other resources,
WaitCondition pauses the execution of stack creation and waits for
specified number of success signals (for a given period) before stack
creation continues.

There are three properties associated with

Type: AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition

Properties:

Count: Integer

Handle: String

Timeout: String

This is the number of success signals the CloudFormation should receive
before it continues the creation of the stack.

It refers to the wait-for condition handle used to signal the wait condition.


---

### Page 345


The length of time (in seconds) to wait for the number of signals that the
specifies.

The usage of wait conditions is useful in those situations where there is a
need to coordinate stack resource creation with configuration actions
external to stack creation (hybrid on on-premises).

Creation policies also pause the creation of resources until a requested
number of success signals are received (like wait conditions). AWS
recommends creation policies for use with EC2 and Autoscaling. Possible
use cases include creating EC2 instances, but the instances also require
some software or third-party libraries to be installed. Without a creation
policy, the EC2 instances will appear ready before the software or third-
party libraries are installed. Like wait conditions, we specify timeout and
number of success signals in creation policies.

1.  CreationPolicy:

2.   AutoScalingCreationPolicy:

3.     MinSuccessfulInstancesPercent.: Integer

4.   ResourceSignal:

5.     Count: Integer

Cross stack references

CloudFormation allows exporting resources from one CloudFormation
stack to another. This methodology let us use layered or service-oriented
architecture. Instead of including resources in a single stack, we can create
related sources in separate stacks then they can refer to required resource
outputs from other stacks. For example, one network stack creates VPCs,
subnets and security groups and the web application stack create EC2
instance that uses the security group from network stack as shown in
Figure

We use export field in output section of stack’s template. To import these
values we use Fn::ImportValue intrinsic

CloudFormation stack updates

There are two methods for updating CloudFormation stacks: Direct update or
create/execute change sets. When we update the stack with the direct update,
CloudFormation immediately deploys the change. This kind of update is
suitable for development or testing environments but not in production
environments because it does not allow reviewing the changes before
updating them. However, using change set we get an opportunity to review
the changes before updating them as shown in Figure


Figure 4.16: CloudFormation Stack Update by Change Set

In this example, we will walk through a simple use case where we create an
EC2 instance and assign a tag Using the change we update the stack by
updating the tag (from environment=test to

Drift detection and remediation

In AWS CloudFormation, drift occurs when the current resource
configuration in AWS environment differs from the expected resource
configuration defined in the CloudFormation stack. This can happen due
to manual changes made outside of CloudFormation or due to other
factors, such as infrastructure changes. CloudFormation can detect such
drift and can help us bring the resource back to its expected state. In this
example, we will create a CloudFormation stack and intentionally make
changes to its resources via the AWS console. Next, we will take
advantage of the CloudFormation Drift detection feature to visualize the
changes and resolve the drift. Follow the step-by-step instructions below
to test this use-case in your AWS account.

Conclusion

In this chapter, we learned how AWS CloudFormation provides a
powerful and flexible way to manage infrastructure as code. We covered
several advanced topics such as the use of nested stacks, Lambda-backed
custom resources, cross-stack references, and stack updates. We also
highlighted the key differences between WaitCondition and which can
help us better control the timing and success of resource creation within a
CloudFormation stack. By leveraging these features and best practices, we
can create, manage, and update complex infrastructures with ease, while
improving the scalability, reliability, and security of your cloud-based
applications.

In the next chapter, we will explore additional tools and services that can
help further improve our cloud infrastructure management and
development. We will start by discussing CloudFormation StackSets,
which allows us to manage multiple CloudFormation stacks across
multiple accounts and regions with ease. We will also introduce the AWS
Cloud Development Kit a high-level object-oriented framework for
defining AWS resources using familiar programming languages.
Additionally, we will cover AWS AppConfig, AWS Control Tower, AWS
Detective, AWS App2Container, and AWS Copilot, which offer various
capabilities for application configuration, governance, security, migration,
and deployment. By mastering these tools and services, we can streamline
our cloud operations and delivery, and achieve greater agility and
innovation in our business.


---

### Page 373


Points to remember

Nested stacks are used to simplify the management of complex
infrastructure. Each nested stack has its own set of parameters and
resources. We can use the outputs from one stack as inputs to another
stack. CloudFormation rolls back all the nested stacks if any one of them
fails. When updating a stack that holds nested stacks, CloudFormation
updates the resources in the nested stacks first, and then updates the
resources in the parent stack.

Drift detection is the process of identifying differences between the
expected and actual state of a resource or stack. CloudFormation provides
drift detection capability for stacks and individual resources. We can use
the AWS CLI, AWS SDKs, or the AWS Management Console to detect
drift. Remediation is the process of correcting drift by bringing the
resource or stack back into the expected state.

Custom resources enable us to write custom provisioning logic in
templates. They are particularly useful in situations when we want to
include the resources in the template that are not available in AWS
CloudFormation resource types. These resources can be included by using
custom resources.

Change Sets in AWS CloudFormation allows us to preview changes
before updating the stack. For example, if changes will remove or replace


---

### Page 374

critical resources. CloudFormation will only make changes to the stack if
we decide to execute the change set.

WaitCondition is a CloudFormation resource, while CreationPolicy is an
attribute associated with other resources. When we need to pause the
creation of an EC2 instance or multiple instances in an auto-scaling group,
and make the stack wait for applications to be installed and started on the
instances, think of And, when we want to coordinate resource creation
with actions external to the stack, think of WaitCondition with a
DependsOn attribute on the resource.

Questions

What is the purpose of Fn::ImportValue intrinsic function?

Create a CloudFormation template that takes a parameter named AmiId
and uses the intrinsic function Ref to pass the AmiId input parameter to
the EC2 resource property?

Create a CloudFormation template that takes AmiId and EC2InstanceType
as input parameter and uses them to create an EC2 instance. The EC2
instance type should be tagged, and the Fn::Sub intrinsic function should
be used to return the type of EC2 instance.


---

### Page 376

The intrinsic function Fn::ImportValue is used to return the value of an
output exported by another stack and is used for creating cross-stack
references.

For example, to export a value from a stack, we can use the Outputs
section in the CloudFormation template as shown below:
1.  Outputs:

2.   MyOutputValue:

3.     Value: A value to export

4.     Export:

5.       Name: MyExportedValue

To import the value from another stack, we can use the export name with
the Fn::ImportValue intrinsic function as shown below:
1.  !ImportValue MyExportedValue

In the following CloudFormation template, we have defined a parameter
named AmiId in parameters section on line 2. The template uses the Ref
intrinsic function to pass the AmiId parameter value to the EC2 instance
property on line 10.
1.  Parameters:

Introduction

In the previous chapter, we learned about AWS CloudFormation and its
capabilities for managing infrastructure as code. In this chapter, we will
extend our knowledge of CloudFormation by exploring how to deploy
stacks across multiple accounts and regions using CloudFormation
StackSets.

We will also delve into the AWS Cloud Development Kit a powerful tool
that allows you to define AWS resources using familiar programming
languages and automatically generates CloudFormation templates for you.

Additionally, this chapter will cover AWS Copilot, a command-line tool
designed to simplify the deployment and management of containerized
applications on AWS, and AWS App2Container, a tool that helps migrate
legacy applications into container format for seamless deployment on
## AWS.

We will also discuss AWS AppConfig, a service for managing application
configurations and feature flags, and AWS Detective, a security analysis
service that helps identify the root cause of security findings or suspicious
activities.

CloudFormation StackSets

CloudFormation StackSets enables us to create, update, or delete stacks
across multiple AWS regions and accounts with a single operation. Using an
administrator account, we can define and manage an AWS CloudFormation
template and provision stacks into specified AWS regions and target accounts.

Two permission models can be used to deploy stack sets: Self-managed or
service-managed. With self-managed, we create AWS Identity and Access
Management roles that set up the trust between accounts, whereas in service-
managed, we deploy stack instances to accounts that are managed by AWS
organizations.

In this example, we will deploy a CloudFormation template that provisions an
S3 bucket across four regions. We will create a stack set using this template
and AWS CLI commands with self-managed permissions. To keep this use
case simple, we will utilize one account that has both administrator and
execution roles. We can utilize StackSets across multiple accounts as well.

The architecture of this use case is shown in Figure



---

### Page 386


Figure 5.1: CloudFormation StackSets

To complete this use case on your AWS account, please follow the step-by-
step instructions given below:

1. Creating a StackSet admin role: AWS CloudFormation StackSets require
specific permissions to deploy CloudFormation stacks across multiple AWS
regions. To create the AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole IAM
role in the us-east-1 region using the CLI, run the following command:
1.  aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name stackset-admin-role-stack \

2.  --template-url https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-stackset-sample-
templates-us-east-1/AWSCloudFormationStackSetAdministrationRole.yml \

3.  --region us-east-1 \

4.  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM



---

### Page 387

The resulting IAM role is shown in Figure


Figure 5.2: CloudFormation created StackSet admin role

2. Creating StackSet execution In addition to the administrator role, AWS
CloudFormation StacksSets require an execution role to deploy stacks in
target accounts. To create the AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole
IAM role in the us-east-1 region using the CLI, run the following command:
1.  aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name stackset-execution-role-
stack \

2.  --parameters
ParameterKey=AdministratorAccountId,ParameterValue=111111111111 \

3.  --template-url https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-stackset-sample-
templates-us-east-1/AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole.yml \

4.  --region us-east-1 \

5.  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM



---

### Page 388

The resulting IAM role is shown in Figure


Figure 5.3: CloudFormation created StackSet execution role

3. Creating StackSet CloudFormation Create a CloudFormation template
named template.yml that creates an S3 bucket with a unique name that
incorporates the AWS account ID and the AWS region:
1.  AWSTemplateFormatVersion:  2010-09-09

2.  Description: 'This template creates an S3 Bucket'

3.  Resources:

4.   MyS3Bucket:

5.     Type: AWS::S3::Bucket

6.     Properties:

7.       BucketName: !Sub stackset-demo-
bucket-${AWS::AccountId}-${AWS::Region}


---

### Page 389


4. Deploying StackSet: Run the following command using CLI to create a
stack set in the us-east-1 region that creates an S3 bucket using the YAML
template provided in the previous section:

1.  aws cloudformation create-stack-set \

2.     --stack-set-name multiregion-s3bucket-stack-set \

3.     --template-body file://template.yml \

4.     --description "Multi Region S3 Bucket" \

5.     --region us-east-1

Figure 5.4 shows the stack set that was created from the above command:


Figure 5.4: Created stack set



---

### Page 390

To verify that the stack set has been created, run the following command
using CLI:
1.  aws cloudformation list-stack-sets

The command output should look like this:
1.  {

2.     "Summaries": [

3.         {

4.             "Status": "ACTIVE",

1.             "Description": "Multi Region S3 Bucket",

5.             "DriftStatus": "NOT_CHECKED",

6.             "StackSetName": "multiregion-s3bucket-stack-set",

7.             "StackSetId": "multiregion-s3bucket-stack-set:53c009ec-99ad-
43b4-9819-16029d4ab8b5"

8.         }

9.     ]

10.  }

The output shows that the stack set has been created successfully and is in an
active state.


---

### Page 391


5. Adding stack To add stack instances in one account and four regions and to
the previously created stack set, run the following command using CLI:
1.  aws cloudformation create-stack-instances \

2.     --stack-set-name multiregion-s3bucket-stack-set \

3.     --accounts 111111111111 \

4.     --regions us-east-1 us-east-2 us-west-1 us-west-2 \

5.     --operation-preferences
FailureToleranceCount=0,MaxConcurrentCount=1

The command creates stack instances in the specified AWS account and
regions and specifies an operation preference to tolerate zero failures and a
maximum concurrency of 1 stack instance at a time.

The command output should look like this:
1.  {

2.     "OperationId": "6d1f2870-731e-4843-8758-b7f7c6ba7277"

3.  }

To verify if the stack instances were created successfully, run the following
command with the operation ID returned from the above command:
1.  aws cloudformation describe-stack-set-operation \



---

### Page 392

2.     --stack-set-name multiregion-s3bucket-stack-set \

3.     --operation-id 6d1f2870-731e-4843-8758-b7f7c6ba7277

The command output should show the status of the stack set operation,
including the execution role, operation preferences, and timestamps:
1.  {

2.     "StackSetOperation": {

3.         "Status": "SUCCEEDED",

4.         "AdministrationRoleARN": "arn:aws:iam::

5.         "OperationPreferences": {

6.             "FailureToleranceCount": 0,

7.             "MaxConcurrentCount": 1,

8.             "RegionOrder": []

9.         },

10.         "AWSCloudFormationStackSetExecutionRole",

11.         "EndTimestamp": "2023-03-31T01:51:46.474Z",



---

### Page 393

12.         "Action": "CREATE",

13.         "CreationTimestamp": "2023-03-31T01:48:13.458Z",

14.         "multiregion-s3bucket-stack-set:53c009ec-99ad-43b4-9819-
16029d4ab8b5",

15.         "OperationId": "6d1f2870-731e-4843-8758-b7f7c6ba7277"

16.     }

17.  }

6. Validation: Now it is time to check if the S3 bucket has been created in any
of the specified regions with the AWS account ID and respective AWS region
as part of the bucket name. Let us check in the us-west-2 (Oregon) region, as
shown in Figure


Figure 5.5: S3 bucket created in us-west-2 (Oregon) region



---

### Page 394

Similarly, if we check the other regions, we can observe that the S3 buckets
have been created.

In conclusion, using AWS CloudFormation stack sets provides an efficient
and streamlined way to deploy resources across multiple accounts and
regions, reducing manual effort and ensuring compliance. The successful
creation of the S3 bucket stack set in this example demonstrates the benefits
of using AWS CloudFormation for multi-account and multi-region resource
deployment.

Creating an S3 Bucket with AWS CDK

AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source framework that
enables the definition and provisioning of cloud infrastructure in code, using
familiar programming languages such as TypeScript, JavaScript, Python,
Java, C# and Go. AWS CDK uses a higher-level abstraction over AWS
CloudFormation, which allows developers to create reusable and
customizable components that can be utilized across multiple projects.

The AWS CDK uses three major building blocks to provision infrastructure in
AWS: Constructs, apps, and stacks. Constructs can contain a single AWS
resource or multiple resources together. A stack is a collection of AWS
resources that are created and managed together as a single unit. An app
consolidates all the stacks and constructs together in one application and
deploys them to AWS.

In this example, we will create an AWD CDK using the sample blank
template provided by the framework. We will use the Bucket construct to add
the code for an S3 bucket to the app. Next, we will synthesize the stack in the
app to create an AWS CloudFormation template. Finally, we will deploy the
stack to our AWS account to create the S3 bucket.

The architecture of this use case is shown in Figure



---

### Page 396


Figure 5.6: Create an S3 bucket with AWS CDK

To complete this use case on your AWS account, please follow the step-by-
step instructions below:

These are the prerequisites:
• AWS CLI installed and configured

• AWS CDK kit installed

• Python 3.9+ installed

Creating a project Create an empty directory named my-s3bucket-cdk and
change the directory to it. This directory will contain the CDK app and its
local dependencies:


---

### Page 397

1.  mkdir my-s3bucket-cdk

2.  cd my-s3bucket-cdk

Initializing the In this step, we will initialize the AWS CDK app by running
the following command using the AWS CLI:
1.  cdk init app --language python

In this command, we specify the blank sample template provided by AWS
CDK and the programming language used, which is Python.

Once the initialization process is completed, we will observe that the app’s
Python virtual environment is also created.

The cdk init command creates several files and folders inside the to structure
the source code for the AWS CDK app. The structure of the folder is as
shown below:
1.  ├── app.py

2.  ├── cdk.json

3.  ├── my_s3bucket_cdk

4.  │  ├── __init__.py

5.  │  └── my_s3bucket_cdk_stack.py

6.  ├── README.md

12.     └── unit

13.         ├── __init__.py

14.         └── test_my_s3bucket_cdk_stack.p

Activating virtual Once the app has been created, run the following command
to activate the virtual environment:
1.  source .venv/bin/activate

Installing Python After activating the virtual environment, install the AWS
CDK core dependencies by running the following command:
1.  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Listing the stacks in the To list the stacks in our AWS CDK app, run the
following command using the AWS CLI:
1.  cdk ls

The above command should result in


---

### Page 399


Adding S3 Now, we will define an S3 bucket in the stack using the bucket
construct. Change the directory to my-s3bucket-cdk and replace the contents
of file named the following:
1.  import aws_cdk as cdk

2.  import aws_cdk.aws_s3 as s3

3.

4.  class MyS3BucketCdkStack(cdk.Stack):

5.

6.     def scope: cdk.App, construct_id: str, **kwargs) -> None:

7.         super().__init__(scope, construct_id, **kwargs)

8.

9.         bucket = s3.Bucket(self, "MyCDKDemoBucket", versioned=True)

Synthesizing the CloudFormation To generate an AWS CloudFormation
template from our AWS CDK app, run the following command using the
## AWS CLI:
1.  cdk synth

The command executes our app and translates the resources defined in the
app into an AWS CloudFormation template. This resulting template is saved


---

### Page 400

in the cdk.out directory.

Deploying Bootstrap The first time, when we deploy an AWS CDK app, we
need to install the bootstrap stack in our AWS account. Run the following
command using AWS CLI to deploy the bootstrap stack:
1.  cdk bootstrap

This stack will install resources such as an S3 bucket to store files and IAM
roles that grant the necessary permissions for deployment. Figure that a
CloudFormation stack named CDKToolkit has been created.


Figure bootstrap stack

Once we have bootstrapped the environment, we can proceed with the
deployment of our app.

Deploying the To deploy the AWS CDK stack using AWS CloudFormation,
run the following command using the CLI:
1.  cdk deploy

This command will create an S3 bucket resource defined in our app according
to the AWS CloudFormation template generated by the cdk synth command.
After running cdk we should wait until the status of MyS3BucketCdkStack
changes to

Implementing feature flags using AWS AppConfig

AWS AppConfig is a fully managed service that quickly deploys application
configurations to different targets such as AWS Lambda, AWS EC2,
containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices in a controlled manner.
AppConfig provides built-in validators which do syntactic or semantic checks
to ensure that the configuration which we want to deploy to the targets works
as intended. This prevents those situations where a simple typo in
configuration can cause an unexpected outage to the system.

Also, during the configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the
application to ensure deployment is successful. If there is an issue found
during the deployment AppConfig will roll back the changes to reduce the
impact on application users by using the appropriate deployment strategy
based on your use cases.

Figure 5.10 visually represents the process of how AppConfig deploys
configurations to Lambda, EC2, and containers:



---

### Page 404


Figure 5.10: Deployment of AWSConfig to EC2, Lambda, and ECS

In this example, we will demonstrate how to implement a feature flag in AWS
AppConfig to manage a specific functionality within your application using
AWS CLI commands. We will be using a feature flag named
is_virus_scanning to control the usage of a third-party vendor’s virus-
scanning engine. In some AWS regions, this vendor’s product does not
support virus scanning, making this flag particularly useful. By using
AppConfig, we can easily enable or disable the virus scanning feature based
on the region where your application is deployed. This approach allows us to
maintain granular control over the availability of the virus scanning
functionality across different regions while minimizing the potential impact
on application performance and user experience.

To complete this use case on your AWS account, please follow the step-by-
step instructions below. These are the prerequisites:
• AWS CLI is installed.

1.  aws appconfig create-application \

2.     --name "my_serverless_app" \

3.     --description "my serverless application" \

4.     --region us-east-1

The above command outputs the following. Make a note of the application
ID, which will be required in the next step when we create an environment:
1.  {

2.     "Name": "my_serverless_app",

3.     "Description": "my serverless application",

4.     "Id": "dbved23"

Deploying API with AWS Copilot

AWS Copilot is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that simplifies the
process of deploying, managing, and operating containerized applications on
AWS. With Copilot, developers can easily create, deploy, and manage
production-ready containerized applications on Amazon Elastic Container
Service AWS Fargate, and AWS App Runner. Copilot helps manage the entire
lifecycle of application development, from setting up the infrastructure to
scaling and monitoring the application in production.

The interaction between AWS Copilot, ECS, Fargate, and App Runner is
depicted in the diagram below in Figure


Figure 5.17: AWS Copilot and container orchestration Services on AWS

### Page 417


In this example, we will deploy a simple front-end service that can be
accessed in a web browser. To do this, we will provide the source code for a
Python web application using Flask, along with any necessary` Python
dependencies and a Dockerfile. Copilot will take care of building and
deploying the Flask web application to AWS, streamlining the deployment
process, and making it easier to manage the application going forward.

To complete this use case on your AWS account, please follow the step-by-
step instructions below. These are the prerequisites:
• AWS CLI installed and configured.

• AWS Copilot installed locally.

• Docker installed and the docker daemon is running.

Preparing the source code: Create a folder named In this folder we will create
files with the following structure:
├── app.py

├── Dockerfile

└── requirements.txt

This file lists the necessary Python dependencies required by the Flask web
application:
1.  Flask==2.1.3

2.  Werkzeug==2.2.2

Initializing the application: To initialize the application with Copilot, the first
step is to run the copilot init command. This command creates a new
application in the directory that contains our services. It also creates IAM
roles and the necessary infrastructure for our services. Additionally, it creates
a sub-directory named copilot that contains manifest files and additional
infrastructure for our services.


---

### Page 420


To accomplish this, run the following command using the AWS CLI:
1.  copilot init --app my-copilot-webapp --name my-webapp --type "Load
Balanced Web Service" --dockerfile ./Dockerfile --port 5000

Choose Copilot asks if we want to deploy a test environment, as shown in
Figure We will be setting up the application environment in the next step.


Figure application by Copilot

Initializing and deploy the environment: Run the following command using
AWS CLI to configure an environment named as shown below:
1.  copilot env init --name staging --default-config --profile default

The above command will create an environment named the name profile a
new VPC and multi-AZ using our AWS credentials. Each AZ will have a
public and private subnet. Copilot will also create a manifest file at the path
which we can customize based on our needs.



---

### Page 421

To deploy the environment, run the following command:
1.  copilot env deploy --name staging

It will take several minutes to complete the environment. Once it is done, we
can see a summary of the AWS resources created by Copilot for the staging
environment, as shown in Figure


Figure created for staging environment by Copilot

The AWS resources created by Copilot include an ECS cluster to group
services, a security group to containers for communicating with each other, an
internet gateway to connect to the public subnet, two private subnets on two
AZs, two public subnets on two AZs, a private DNS namespace to discover
the service within the environment and a VPC that controls the networking of
these created resources.

Deploying the app: To deploy the application to the staging environment, run
the following command in the root directory of the application:
1.  copilot svc deploy --name my-webapp --env staging

This command will deploy the service specified by the --name flag (in this
case, my-webapp) to the environment specified by the --env flag (in this case,

staging). During the deployment process, Copilot will create the necessary
resources in the AWS account and region specified in the environment
configuration.

Testing the Test the application by running the following command, which
will return the information about the deployed service, including endpoints,
capacity, and related resources in the staging environment:
1.  copilot svc show --name my-webapp

Figure the result of the above command, including the endpoint URL of
staging the environment:

project and create an executable JAR file in the target directory:

1.  mvn clean install

Execute the following command to start the application:
1.  java -jar target/my-spring-boot-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar


---

### Page 431


By default, the application will be running on port 8080, as shown in Figure


Figure 5.23: Java Spring Boot application started

5. Testing the application: Now, create a new session in your Linux terminal
and run curl on port 8080. You should see the Hello from my Spring Boot
app! message, as shown in Figure


Figure 5.24: Output of the ‘Hello World’ Spring Boot Application

6. Installing and initializing App2Container: Please refer to the following
AWS documentation:
•  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app2container/latest/UserGuide/start-step2-
initialize.html

•  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app2container/latest/UserGuide/start-step1-
install.html



---

### Page 432

These resources will provide detailed instructions on how to install and set up
the App2Container CLI for our environment. After installing and initializing
App2Container, we will be ready to start containerizing our Java application
in the next step.

7. Discovering the application: Execute the following command in your
terminal, which will start discovering the Java application running on the
system, create an inventory, and analyze it:

1.  app2container inventory

Figure 5.25 displays the output in JSON format with the Java application ID
highlighted. Take note of this ID, as it will be required in the subsequent
steps:


Figure 5.25: JSON output with Java application ID highlighted

8. Analyzing the application: Using the Java application ID from the previous
step, execute the following command in your Linux terminal:
1.  app2container analyze --application-id java-generic-b437f9e7

Figure 5.26 shows the output of the analyze command and provides

command

9. Containerizing the application: Execute the following command using the
Java application ID obtained in the previous step:
1.  app2container containerize --application-id java-generic-b437f9e7

The containerization process will take several minutes to complete.
App2Container will create the Dockerfile and a deployment.json file, which
contains AWS deployment-related information. App2Container also pre-
validates the container to ensure it works as expected, as shown in Figure


Figure 5.27: App2Container containerization process and pre-validation
output

10. Creating deployment artifacts: Run the following command on your
terminal which generates artifacts to deploy the containerized application in
## AWS:
1.  app2container generate app-deployment --application-id java-generic-
b437f9e7


---

### Page 434


This process will take several minutes to complete. Once it is done, we will
see that App2Container has created an ECR repository containing the
application container image from earlier steps, a local ECS task definition, a
registered ECS task definition with ECS, and uploaded all CloudFormation
templates to the S3 bucket provided during the Install and Initialize
App2Container step.

Figure 5.28 displays the summary of all actions performed by App2Container
during the creation of deployment artifacts:


Figure 5.28: Summary of actions performed by App2Container for
deployment artifacts creation

11. Deploying CloudFormation template to AWS: At this stage, the
application image is already present in the ECR repository, and
App2Container has created a master CloudFormation template to deploy and
configure all resources in AWS.

To achieve this, execute the following command in your terminal:
1.  app2container generate app-deployment --application-id java-generic-
b437f9e7 --deploy


---

### Page 435


This process will take several minutes and create multiple CloudFormation
stacks, such as a Load Balanced Web Application stack, an ECS Cluster and a
VPC as shown in Figure


Figure 5.29: Created CloudFormation stacks for load balanced web
application, ECS cluster, and VPC

Figure 5.30 displays the confirmation that the deployment is successful for
the Java application, and the URL of the Load Balancer endpoint is
highlighted:



---

### Page 436


Figure 5.30: Successful deployment confirmation and Load Balancer
endpoint URL highlighted

Now, if we take the URL mentioned above and open it in the browser it will
display the message Hello from my Spring Boot app! as shown in Figure
which is the same as shown in Figure 5.23 before containerizing the
application.

Key components of the AWS Control Tower

AWS Control Tower simplifies the process of configuring and governing
AWS multi-account environments while adhering to best practices. AWS
Control Tower orchestrates on top of AWS services such as AWS
Organizations, AWS Service Catalog, and AWS IAM Identity Center
(which is the successor to AWS Single Sign-On) to build landing zones.

Figure 5.32 illustrates the integration of AWS Control Tower with these
services. This visual representation helps to demonstrate how these
services work together to create a cohesive and well-architected multi-
account environment.




---

### Page 438


Figure 5.32: Control Tower environment diagram

The following are key concepts and terminology to remember concerning
the exam:
• Landing zone: It is a well-architected, multi-account AWS environment
that provides a secure, scalable, and efficient foundation for managing and
running workloads in the cloud. It is designed to meet security,
compliance, and operational best practices.

• Account factory: It offers configurable account templates that
standardize the provisioning and configuration of new accounts.

• Guardrails: They are the high-level rules that govern the overall Control
Tower and can be implemented through Service Control Policies (SCP) or
AWS Config rules.

• Member accounts: They belong to the Control Tower organization and
can be enrolled or unenrolled in Control Tower.

• Shared accounts: They are the management, log archive, and audit
accounts that are automatically provisioned when setting up a landing
zone using Control Tower.

Enhancing security analysis with AWS Detective

AWS Detective assists in analyzing, investigating, and promptly identifying
the root cause of security-related findings or suspicious activities. It
automatically collects logs data from AWS resources, including CloudTrail
logs, EKS audit logs, VPC flow logs, and AWS GuardDuty findings. By
leveraging machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory, AWS
Detective produces visualizations that enable customers to conduct in-depth
root cause analysis for security incidents.

Please refer to the accompanying Figure which illustrates the interaction
between Amazon Detective and the AWS services, providing a visual
representation of their integration and collaboration in enhancing security
analysis:

Conclusion

In this chapter, we learned how CloudFormation StackSets enable the
deployment of stacks across multiple accounts and regions, while AWS
CDK allows for infrastructure provisioning in code using familiar
programming languages. We also looked at AWS AppConfig, which
enables controlled deployment of application configurations, and AWS
Copilot, which simplifies the process of deploying containerized
applications.

Furthermore, we discussed AWS App2Container, which provides a
solution for migrating and modernizing legacy applications to
containerized formats in AWS.

We also covered AWS Control Tower for configuring and governing AWS
multi-account environments, and AWS Detective for enhanced security
analysis.

In the next chapter, we will explore Elastic Beanstalk and OpsWorks.
We’ll also dive into AWS API Gateway essentials, build an HTTP API
using Lambda, DynamoDB, and AWS SAM, and learn about Lambda-
based canary deployment using AWS SAM. Lastly, we’ll explore
deployment strategies in AWS OpsWorks, create custom Cookbooks, and
deploy a Node.js application in AWS ECS.

Points to remember

CloudFormation StackSets in AWS enable automated deployment of
resources across multiple regions and accounts in a single operation.
StackSets can be created using either self-managed or service-managed
permissions.

The AWS CDK allows developers to define cloud infrastructure in code.
Key components are constructs (single/multiple AWS resources), stacks
(resource collections), and apps (combining and deploying stacks and
constructs).

AWS AppConfig is a managed service that allows for controlled
deployment of application configurations. It can be used to implement
feature flags, which enable granular control over specific functionalities of
your application. AppConfig also monitors deployment, rolling back
changes if issues occur, minimizing impact on users.

AWS Copilot is a command line interface tool that simplifies deploying
and managing containerized applications on AWS. With Copilot, you can
focus on writing code while it handles the underlying infrastructure,
making it an efficient solution for managing the entire lifecycle of your
applications.

AWS App2Container (A2C) is a command-line tool that aids in the
migration of applications to a container-based infrastructure. It automates

This file is a NGINX configuration file. It sets up NGINX to serve as a
reverse proxy for the PHP application. The configuration listens on ports
80 (IPv4 and IPv6), sets the server name to localhost, specifies the root
directory and index file for content, and configures the processing of PHP
files. This includes defining how to pass PHP requests to the FastCGI
server on port and how to handle file paths and script names for PHP
processing.

Configure Elastic Beanstalk using .ebextensions

There are three main ways to configure the Elastic Beanstalk environment
using Direct Changes, Saved configurations, and Configuration files

In this section, we learn how to configure the Elastic Beanstalk environment
using .ebextension configuration file. The .ebextensions configuration file is a
YAML or JSON formatted document with a .config file extension. This file is
placed in a folder called .ebextensions and deployed along with the
application source bundle. Their configuration files specify a wide range of
customizations, including installing packages, modifying configurations files,
and running scripts.

This configuration file will customize the Apache HTTP server and PHP on
an Amazon Linux EC2 instance within the Elastic Beanstalk environment. We
will use the Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface to provision the
Elastic Beanstalk environment.

Follow the step-by-step process below to complete this use case on your AWS
account:

1. Create an app Start by creating a directory named my-eb-app and navigate
to it:
1.  mkdir my-eb-app

2.  cd my-eb-app



---

### Page 473

2. Create a PHP file: Within the my-eb-app directory, create a subdirectory
named Then, create a file named index.php and add the following content to
it:
1.

2.  echo "Hello, World!";

3.  ?>

3. Create .ebextensions directory: Now, create a configuration file named
php-apache-settings.config inside a hidden directory named .ebextensions in
the root of app directory named Copy and paste the following contents into
the php-apache-settings.config file:

php-apache-settings.config
1.  option_settings:

2.   aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:

3.     ProxyServer: apache

4.   aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:php:phpini:

5.     document_root: /public

6.     memory_limit: 128M

7.     zlib.output_compression: "Off"



---

### Page 474

8.     allow_url_fopen: "On"

9.     display_errors: "Off"

10.     max_execution_time: 60

The previous configuration file customizes Apache and PHP settings. It
configures Apache as the proxy server, ensuring efficient handling of web
requests. For PHP, it sets the application’s document root to adjusts the
memory limit to 128 MB for adequate script execution, and disables zlib
output compression for performance. The file also enables allow_url_fopen
for accessing remote files, turns off the PHP error display for security, and
limits script execution time to 60 seconds to prevent server resource hogging
by long-running scripts.

4. Initialize and create an Elastic Beanstalk Run the following command
using EB CLI to initialize an Elastic Beanstalk environment and associate it
with your local repository:
1.  eb init my-eb-app -p "PHP 8.0" --region us-east-1

5. Deploy an Elastic Beanstalk Environment: Now, execute the following
command using the EB CLI to create an Elastic Beanstalk environment
named my-eb-env and deploy an application version from your local
repository:
1.  eb create my-eb-env

The Elastic Beanstalk environment creation might take few minutes. Wait
until the environment’s health check changes to After the environment is
ready, access the Elastic Beanstalk console, locate your environment, and


---

### Page 475

click on the provided environment URL to access your deployed application
as shown in Figure


Figure 6.10: Health check is passed for Elastic Beanstalk Environment

As soon as we click on the environment it opens a separate tab on the browser
that displays a PHP web application with a Hello World message as shown in
Figure This confirms we have successfully created an Elastic Beanstalk
environment with custom configuration settings:


Figure 6.11: PHP static website

6. Terminate the Elastic Beanstalk environment: Run the following command
using EB CLI to delete the Elastic Beanstalk environment once we are done
with validation of the Elastic Beanstalk environment.
1.  eb terminate my-eb-env --force

Blue/Green deployment in Elastic Beanstalk

Some Elastic Beanstalk supplies deployment methods are, all at once,
Rolling, Rolling with Additional batches, Immutable and Blue/Green.

In this section, we will learn to use Elastic Beanstalk’s Swap Environment
URL’s feature and perform Blue/Green deployment. This deployment strategy
allows us to deploy newer versions of the application without any downtime
because users are only switched to the new version once it is fully deployed
and tested.

To illustrate this deployment strategy, we have spun up two environments
Blue and Green as shown in Figure Only blue environment serves production
traffic, green environment is ready and evaluated and has its own
environment URL.

Following are the instructions to promote the green environment to serve
production traffic:

Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk Console and click on Environments link on the
left.

Select Blue Environment named My-Blue-Env and go to Actions menu,
choose URLs as shown in Figure Elastic Beanstalk performs a Domain Name
System switch which takes a few minutes to complete.



---

### Page 477


Figure Environment URLs

Once the DNS changes are propagated, we can delete the blue environment.
Now, all the production traffic will be routed to a green environment.


---

### Page 478


Using Elastic Beanstalk with AWS RDS

Adding RDS as part of the Elastic Beanstalk environment is great for
development and testing environments. However, it is not ideal for the
production of environments because it ties the lifecycle of the database
instance to our application’s environment which means if we terminate the
environment, the database instance will be terminated as well. Therefore,
it is best to decouple RDS from Elastic Beanstalk in a Production
environment.

AWS API gateway essentials

API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining,
monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale.
API Gateway is used to create REST APIs, HTTP APIs and WebSocket
APIs.

• Difference between REST API and HTTP Both are RESTful API
products offered by AWS. REST APIs support more features than HTTP
APIs, while HTTP APIs are designed with minimal features so that they
can be offered at a lower price. AWS recommends using REST API if we
need features such as API keys, per-client throttling, request validation
and AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration, otherwise choose
HTTP API if we do not need those features because it is cheaper and
faster.

• Difference between REST API vs. WebSocket Unlike a REST API which
receives and responds to requests, a WebSocket API supports a two-way
communication between client apps and our backend. The backend can
send callback messages to connected clients.

Building HTTP API using Lambda, DynamoDB and AWS SAM

In this section, we create a serverless HTTP API that creates CRUD reads,
updates, and operations on Products from a DynamoDB table using AWS
SAM. We created an HTTP API that integrates with the Lambda function in
the backend. When a client calls API, API gateway sends the request to the
Lambda function and returns the function’s response to the client. The
architecture of this use case is illustrated in Figure

creates lambda function, CodeDeploy application and deployment group
using AWS CloudFormation.

1.  sam deploy \

2.   --template-file package.yml \

3.   --stack-name my-lambda-canary-deployment \

4.   --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

It takes a few minutes for AWS SAM to create a changeset and deploy the
CloudFormation stack. Once stack is provisioned, go to the CloudFormation
and grab physical ID of Lambda function named HelloWorldFunction as
shown in Figure This will be used to find the ARN of Lambda function in
Lambda console.

command in your terminal:

1.  {"statusCode": 200, "body": "Hello, World!"}

2. Update Lambda Now, we make a small change in the Lambda function and
re-run sam package and sam deploy commands:

1.  def lambda_handler(event, context):

2.     return {

3.         "statusCode": 200,

4.         "body": "Hello, DevOps Gurus!"

5.     }

3. View deployment When the deployment is in progress, go to CodeDeploy
console, we can see the Traffic shifting bar and the percentages in the
Original and Replacement boxes as shown in Figure The information
displayed in this figure shows 25 percent of end users are seeing the new
Lambda function for the first five minutes and 75 percent of users will see it
five minutes later.



---

### Page 506


Figure 6.17: Traffic shifting is in-progress in AWS CodeDeploy Console from
old lambda version to newer version

An added check can be performed also by running the following command
using AWS CLI:
1.  aws lambda list-aliases  --function-name my-lambda-canary-deployment-
HelloWorldFunction-yq9Ha4urFwEi

By looking into the output of the above command, we can see that
RoutingConfig | AdditonalVersionWeights is set to .25 for 2 which means 25
percent of users are seeing version 2 of lambda function. Over a period of
five minutes, all traffic is using version 2 of lambda function. This output of
the above command is shown in Figure

Creating a custom cookbook using AWS OpsWorks

Cookbook is a collection of recipes and other supporting files that are used to
configure and manage resources. Recipe is a collection of instructions written
in Ruby language that instructs chef how to configure and manage a
particular resource.

Follow step-by-step instructions to complete this use case on your AWS
account:

1. Create the cookbook: Create a directory named your local terminal. In this
directory, create a text file named metadata.rb and copy the following
contents:
1.  name "sample-cookbook-demo"

Create a subdirectory named recipes inside sample-cookbook-demo directory.
In recipes directory, create a text file named Add a single line of code
statement in this file. This code is a one-line recipe that will display a simple
Hello, DevOps Gurus! message in the log when the recipe runs.
1.  Chef::Log.info("----------- Hello, DevOpsGurus! ---------")

The folder structure inside will look like this:

1.  ├── metadata.rb

2.  └── recipes

AWS OpsWorks Stacks lifecycle events

In this section, we will learn how to run the recipe automatically by assigning
it to OpsWorks layer lifecycle event.

Each layer in OpsWorks has five life cycle events: Setup, Configure, Deploy,
Undeploy and Shutdown. The setup event occurs after an instance finishes
booting, the Configure event occurs when an instance enters or leaves the
online state, the Deploy event occurs when we deploy an application to
instances, the Undeploy event occurs when we terminate an app and
Shutdown event occurs when we shut down the instance.

For this use case, we will use the infrastructure provisioned for OpsWorks
stack, layer, instance, custom cookbook and the recipe.

Deployment strategy in AWS OpsWorks

There are different ways to manage OpsWorks stacks app and custom
cookbooks. In this section, we will talk about each deployment strategy
briefly:
• Manual With manual deployment, we can choose to deploy the latest
version of the app from a particular source repository or specify a
particular version of your app to deploy. This is the fastest way to deploy
but it causes downtime.
• Rolling With rolling deployment, we deploy a new version of the
application to a part of the instances in a layer and then, subsequently roll
it out to the remaining instances. This allows us to evaluate the new
version on a smaller number of instances before rolling it out to the entire
fleet. This deployment reduces downtime, but failed deployment causes
reduced ability and requires re-deployment to affected instances in case of
failure.
• Blue/Green To implement this technique in AWS OpsWorks, we bring
up the blue environment/stack with the current version of the application.
Next, we create the green environment/stack with the newer version of the
application. When it is time to promote the green environment/stack into
production, we update DNS records to point to the green
environment/stack’s load balancer. We can also do this by DNS flip
gradually by using the Amazon Route 53 weighted routing policy. This
technique reduces the downtime and risk during the deployment.

Conclusion

In this chapter, you have navigated through a variety of practical AWS
deployment scenarios, gaining hands-on skills and valuable insights. You
have learned how to effectively deploy multi-container Docker
applications using Elastic Beanstalk, configure setups using and employ
blue/green deployment strategies. The introduction to AWS API Gateway
and the creation of an HTTP API with Lambda, DynamoDB, and AWS
SAM have illustrated the power of efficient interfaces and updates. The
exploration of AWS OpsWorks has expanded your knowledge of app
deployment and orchestration. As you reflect on this chapter, you will
recognize the immediate relevance of these skills in crafting robust and
optimized AWS deployments.

In the upcoming chapter, Implement High Availability, Scalability, and
Fault you will further elevate your expertise by delving into Auto Scaling
Launch Templates, Policies, and lifecycle Hooks, mastering Termination
Policies, and exploring scaling based on Amazon SQS. These skills, along
with Load Balancer setup, application deployment strategies, DynamoDB
insights, and RDS High Availability techniques, will empower you to
create resilient and scalable AWS solutions, solidifying your position as a
proficient AWS practitioner.


---

### Page 536


Points to remember

• Elastic Beanstalk can be configured using Direct Changes, Saved
Configurations, or files, with the latter allowing extensive customization
like package installations and script execution.

• While integrating RDS with Elastic Beanstalk is suitable for
development and testing, it is recommended to decouple RDS in
production to avoid lifecycle dependencies.

• AWS OpsWorks layers feature five lifecycle events: setup (post-instance
boot), configure (instance state changes), deploy (application
deployment), undeploy (application termination), and shutdown (instance
shutdown). These events automate tasks corresponding to each stage of
the instance and application lifecycle.

• In AWS OpsWorks, deployment strategies include manual (fast but
causes downtime), rolling (staged rollout minimizing downtime but
complex on failure), and Blue/Green (reduces risk by alternating between
two environments).

• In AWS OpsWorks, a cookbook is a collection of recipes and other
supporting files used to configure and manage resources. Each recipe is a
set of instructions written in the Ruby language that instructs the Chef
how to configure and manage a specific resource.

Questions

1. How many types of deployment configurations are supported by AWS
CodeDeploy on AWS Lambda compute platform?

2. What is the order of precedence for the configuration options in an
AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment’s behavior?

3. What are the main differences between REST APIs and HTTP APIs in
## AWS?


---

### Page 538


Answers

1. The deployment configurations supported are Canary, Linear, and All-
at-once.

2. The order of precedence is Settings applied directly to the environment,
Saved Configurations, Configuration Files and then Default Values.

3. REST APIs in AWS offer more features like API keys, throttling, and
AWS WAF integration, suitable for complex applications. HTTP APIs are
simpler and more cost-effective, ideal for basic functionality. Choose
based on your feature requirements and budget.

Introduction

In the previous chapter, we explored deployment and automation using
AWS services, focusing on OpsWorks and Elastic We covered topics
ranging from deploying Docker applications, configuring Elastic
Beanstalk, applying Blue/Green deployment strategies, integrating RDS,
and utilizing Lambda for building HTTP APIs and Canary deployments.

In this chapter, we shift our focus to high availability and scalability in
AWS. We will begin by examining the RDS Multi-AZ setup and testing
failover scenarios. We will delve into the High Availability features of
Aurora DB. We will also learn to set up scalable, load-balanced
applications. Finally, we will explore how lifecycle hooks can invoke
Lambda functions for dynamic responses to instance changes.


---

### Page 541


Structure

In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:
• RDS Multi-AZ setup and failover test

• High availability in Aurora DB

• Setting up a scalable and load-balanced application

• Lifecycle hook invoking Lambda function


---

### Page 542


Objectives

In this chapter, our main goal is to ensure a deep understanding of High
Availability and scalability in AWS. The practical approach will
encompass setting up and testing RDS Multi-AZ, exploring High
Availability in Aurora DB, and creating scalable and load-balanced
applications. We will also gain hands-on experience with AWS lifecycle
hooks and their interaction with Lambda functions. By the end of this
chapter, you will have an in-depth knowledge of these key AWS features
and services, empowering you to create more resilient and scalable
applications.

### Page 543


RDS multi-AZ setup and failover test

In this section, we will explore how to achieve High Availability using
Amazon Relational Database Service With a Multi-AZ DB instance,
Amazon RDS establishes a primary DB Instance and synchronously
duplicates data to a standby instance in another Availability Zone Each AZ
operates on a separate, reliable infrastructure. In the event of an
infrastructure issue, Amazon RDS automatically switches to the standby
(or a read replica for Amazon Aurora), enabling uninterrupted database
functionality. As the DB Instance endpoint remains unchanged post-
failover, manual intervention is unnecessary for your application to
continue database operations. The following figure visually represents the
concepts explained in this section:


Figure 7.1: RDS Multi-AZ setup and failover overview


---

### Page 544


Follow the step-by-step instructions provided below to convert your RDS
instance to a Multi-AZ configuration, initiate fail-over in the Multi-AZ
environment, and verify the success of the fail-over process.


---

### Page 545


Prerequisites

Create an RDS Postgres Single DB Instance with the identifier my-rds-inst
and a DB instance class of db.t3.medium in the burstable classes category:

Verify Multi-AZ setting for RDS: Use the following AWS Command Line
Interface command to determine whether the instance is utilizing Multi-AZ:
1.  aws rds describe-db-instances \

2.   --db-instance-identifier my-rds-inst \

3.   --query 'DBInstances[].MultiAZ' \

4.   --output text \

5.   --region us-east-1

The output False indicates that Multi-AZ is not currently enabled. You can
also check the Multi-AZ settings by navigating to the RDS service console,
scrolling to the right in the database settings for our specified instance (named
TBD), and reviewing the Multi-AZ configuration as shown in Figure



---

### Page 546


Figure instance Multi-AZ configuration status

In the following section, we will set up our database for High Availability:

Configuring High Availability for RDS Use the following AWS CLI
command to convert the RDS instance to Multi-AZ:
1.  aws rds modify-db-instance \

2.   --db-instance-identifier my-rds-inst \

3.   --multi-az \

4.   --apply-immediately \

5.   --region us-east-1

Once the instance transitions to the Modifying status, you need to wait for the
operation to finish, which typically takes around 5-10 minutes. After the
status changes to click on my-rds-inst instance identifier to review its settings.
In the Configuration tab, we will see the region and availability zone where
our primary instance runs at the top-right corner. Additionally, by looking at


---

### Page 547

the bottom, we can identify the secondary availability zone where the second
instance is located, as illustrated in Figure


Figure and secondary instances in RDS Multi-AZ configuration

Creating event subscription: In this step, we will create an event subscription
for the failover event to receive email notifications when the failover event
occurs. Execute the following shell script, which takes an email address as
input, creates an SNS topic, an SNS subscription for the provided email
address, and an RDS event subscription:
1.  #!/bin/sh

2.  email_address=$1

High availability in Aurora DB

In this example, we will guide you through the process of establishing a high-
availability Aurora MySQL DB cluster. The setup involves configuring
compute nodes across multiple availability zones, thereby enhancing read
scalability and providing failover protection. We will also learn in detail how
to manage failover event notifications, simulate failover scenarios, and
monitor the shifting roles of writer and reader nodes within the cluster.

The Aurora MySQL architecture with a master and one-read replica. HA is
inbuilt into the Aurora MySQL architecture with six copies of data
maintained in three different availability zones. In this specific example, we
are considering two availability zones, resulting in four copies of data being
visible, as illustrated in the following figure:


Figure 7.8: Illustration of High Availability architecture in Aurora MySQL



---

### Page 555

If the primary instance fails, Amazon RDS promotes an Aurora Replica to
serve as the new primary instance. This automatic failover process is fully
automated and handled by Aurora.


---

### Page 556


Prerequisites

Two private subnets in different availability zones for High Availability:
private-subnet-id-1 and Replace these placeholder IDs with your actual
subnet IDs as you proceed with the steps.

Creating a DB subnet Use the following AWS CLI command to create a DB
subnet group named my-aurora-subnetgroup using two private subnets in the
1.  aws rds create-db-subnet-group \

2.   --db-subnet-group-name my-aurora-subnetgroup \

3.   --db-subnet-group-description "my db subnet group" \

4.   --subnet-ids '["private-subnet-id-1","private-subnet-id-2"]' \

5.   --region us-east-1

We can verify the creation of DB Subnet group by navigating to the RDS
console and clicking on Subnet groups on the left. Figure the created DB
subnet group:

Creating an AWS Aurora In this step, we will create an empty Aurora DB
cluster named A writer instance will be added explicitly in the following step
using the create-db-instance AWS CLI command. Use the following AWS
CLI command to create a MySQL 5.7 compatible DB cluster:
1.  aws rds create-db-cluster \

2.   --db-cluster-identifier my-aurora-cluster \

3.   --engine aurora-mysql \

4.   --engine-version  5.7 \

5.   --engine-mode provisioned  \

6.   --master-username admin \



---

### Page 558

7.   --master-user-password admin1234 \

8.   --db-subnet-group-name my-aurora-subnetgroup \

9.   --region us-east-1

The preceding command requires a DB subnet group (created in the previous
step), the name of the database engine, the master username for the DB
cluster, the password for the master database user, and the engine mode for
the database engine.

Please note that it may take a few minutes for the cluster to be created. Once
the cluster status becomes you may proceed to the next step to create the
writer instance for the cluster, as shown in the Figure


Figure DB Cluster status

Now, we will add a DB instance to the DB cluster that we created in the
previous step. Use the following AWS CLI command to launch a DB instance
named
1.  aws rds create-db-instance \



---

### Page 559

2.   --db-instance-identifier my-aurora-writer-instance \

3.   --db-instance-class db.t2.small \

4.   --engine aurora-mysql \

5.   --engine-version 5.7 \

6.   --db-cluster-identifier my-aurora-cluster \

7.   --no-multi-az \

8.   --no--publicly-accessible \

9.   --availability-zone us-east-1a

The preceding command takes the DB instance identifier, the compute and
memory capacity of the DB instance class, the name of the database engine to
be used for this instance, and the identifier of the DB cluster from the
previous section. The --no-multi-az parameter indicates that the DB instance
will not be part of the Multi-AZ deployment.

Please note that it may take a few minutes for the DB instance to become
available. The status of the DB instance will initially be creating and will
change to Available once the instance is ready for use. Figure 7.11 displays
the Available status of the DB instance:

Creating an Aurora replica instance for High In this step, we will add another
DB instance to the DB cluster. This instance will be included in the cluster as
an Aurora replica, serving as a reader instance by default. The primary
instance performs all the data modifications in the DB cluster, while Aurora
Replicas replicate the changes and handle read traffic.

Execute the following AWS CLI command to create a reader instance:
1.  aws rds create-db-instance \

2.   --db-instance-identifier my-aurora-reader-instance \

3.   --db-instance-class db.t2.small \

4.   --engine aurora-mysql \

9.   --availability-zone us-east-1b

Please note that it may take a few minutes for the Aurora replica instance to
become available. Once the status transitions to scroll to the right to see the
Multi-AZ Here, 2 Zones will be noticeable, demonstrating that the cluster is
distributed across two Availability Zones at the compute layer, as shown in
Figure


Figure cluster spread across two availability zones

We have now successfully implemented High Availability on the compute
layer. Next, we will proceed to test the DB failover process.



---

### Page 562

Setting up failover event In this step, we will create an Amazon SNS topic,
subscribe your email address to it, establish an RDS event subscription that
publishes to the SNS topic, and register the DB cluster as an event source.
This setup will enable us to receive email alerts for DB cluster failover
events.

For this, we will use the shell script from Step named Create Event
Subscription from the previous section, RDS Multi-AZ Setup and Failover
However, there is a change in the AWS CLI command named create-event-
subscription used in the script, as shown below:
# Create a RDS event subscription

1.  aws rds create-event-subscription \

2.   --subscription-name my-rds-subscription \

3.   --sns-topic-arn $topic_arn \

4.   --source-type db-cluster \

5.   --event-categories failover \

6.   --source-ids my-aurora-cluster \

7.   --region $aws_region \

8.   --enabled

Once the script is executed successfully, navigate to the RDS console, click
on RDS Subscriptions on the left, and open the subscription named Figure the


---

### Page 563

created subscription:


Figure Subscription in RDS Console

Perform database To initiate the failover, execute the following AWS CLI
command:
1.  aws rds failover-db-cluster \

2.   --db-cluster-identifier my-aurora-cluster

This action will promote the replica to the new primary (or writer) instance
and reassign the former primary (or writer) instance as a new read replica.
The failover completion time will vary depending on the amount of database
activity at the time of failover, but it typically takes less than 2 minutes.

Monitoring failover In this step, we will check the email notifications sent
during the failover process and examine RDS log events. Two email
notifications should arrive in your inbox: one indicating the start of failover
and the other confirming its completion.



---

### Page 564

The RDS Notification message stating that cross-AZ failover to the DB
instance has started for the DB cluster is displayed in Figure

The RDS notification about the completion of failover to DB instance my-
aurora-instance is displayed in Figure

---

### Page 565

Monitor failover In this step, we will monitor the events that occurred during
the failover process. To do this, navigate to the RDS console and click on
Events on the left-hand side. Figure 7.16 displays the events associated with
the failover process:


Figure recorded during DB Failover process

Figure 7.17 displays the Aurora DB cluster, where we can observe the
swapped roles of the writer and reader instances. Post failover, the reader
instance has taken over as the writer, while the previous writer has become
the reader. Look at the following figure:

In conclusion, this hands-on example guided you through the process of
setting up a high-availability Aurora MySQL DB cluster, enhancing its
scalability and ensuring failover protection.

Setting up a scalable and load-balanced application

In this tutorial, we will demonstrate the setup of a scalable and load-balanced
application using an auto-scaling group paired with an application load
balancer. The tutorial will guide you through the process of distributing
incoming traffic across robust Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability
Zones, thereby enhancing your application’s fault tolerance and scalability.

Post-setup, we will simulate a stress test using the stress tool. This will help
us validate how our Auto Scaling configuration responds under heavy load,
ensuring that new instances are spun up as expected. The architecture of this
example is depicted in Figure


Figure 7.18: Scalable application with auto scaling and load balancer
architecture

Follow the step-by-step instructions below to execute this use case in your
AWS environment:


---

### Page 569


Prerequisites

This setup requires a VPC and two public subnets: public-subnet-id-1 and
public-subnet-id-2 in different availability zones for High Ensure to replace
the placeholder subnet IDs with your actual subnet IDs as you move through
the following steps:

Creating an application load This step involves the setup of the Balancer
which will distribute incoming traffic across EC2 instances. It involves
configuring a security group for the ALB, setting ingress rules for traffic,
creating a target group for routing, and finally, creating the ALB itself.

Creating a security Run the following AWS CLI command to establish a
security group named This group will manage inbound and outbound traffic
for the Application Load Balancer. This command requires the ID of your
VPC, as displayed in the following code snippet:
1.  aws ec2 create-security-group \

2.   --group-name MYALBSG \

3.   --description "Application Load Balancer Security Group" \

4.   --vpc-id my-vpc-id

Make a note of the security group ID; it will be needed in the following step
when we add an inbound (ingress) rule to it.



---

### Page 570

Adding ingress rule to security Execute the following AWS CLI command to
enable inbound HTTP traffic from anywhere on port
1.  aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \

2.   --group-id app_load_balancer_sg_id \

3.   --protocol tcp \

4.   --port 80 \

5.   --cidr 0.0.0.0/0

Figure the inbound rule added to the security group that is attached to the
application load balancer:

Creating target Use the provided AWS CLI command to establish a target
group for the application load balancer. This target group will allow us to
register targets using instance id type: The target group will utilize the HTTP


---

### Page 571

protocol, port 80 and default health check settings for an HTTP target group.
Take a look at the following code snippet for better understanding:
1.  aws elbv2 create-target-group \

2.   --name MYALBTG \

3.   --protocol HTTP \

4.   --port 80 \

5.   --target-type instance \

6.   --vpc-id my-vpc-id

After creating the target group, make a note of its Amazon Resource Names
This ARN will be required in a future step when we create an HTTP listener.

Figure 7.20 illustrates the settings of the target group such as target type
protocol port number and the VPC Note that currently, the target group is not
associated with any load balancer as displayed in the following figure:



---

### Page 572


Figure settings of target group

Creating application load Utilize the provided AWS CLI command to
generate an internet-facing application load balancer. This command
configures the load balancer to operate across specified subnets and utilizes
the specified security group. Take a look at the following code snippet:
1.  aws elbv2 create-load-balancer \

2.   --name MY-ALB \

3.   --subnets public-subnet-id-1 public-subnet-id-2 \

4.   --security-groups MY-ALB-SG-ID

After creating the application load balancer, note its ARN. This ARN will be
required in the next step when we create an HTTP listener.

Figure the settings of ALB, including the scheme (internet-facing), VPC ID,
availability zones where our public subnets ARN of and DNS name. Note that


---

we have not yet associated any listener with this ALB, as displayed in the
following figure:


Figure settings of the application load balancer

Creating an HTTP Execute the provided CLI command to create an HTTP
listener for the previously created Application Load Balancer. This listener
will forward incoming requests to the specified target group established in
step c, illustrated in the following code snippet:
1.  aws elbv2 create-listener \

2.   --load-balancer-arn MY-ALB-ARN \

Creating a launch template: In this step, we establish a key pair that enables
us to connect to the instances and perform stress testing. Additionally, we
create a security group that allows SSH access to the instances and enables
the Application Load Balancer to direct frontend connections to the instances
on port 80. Finally, we create a launch template that specifies the instance


---

### Page 575

configuration and creation parameters. This launch template will be utilized
by the Auto Scaling group, which we will create in the next step:

Getting the latest Amazon Linux 2 Run the provided AWS CLI command to
retrieve the AMI ID of the latest Amazon Linux 2 AMI in the us-east-1 This
AMI ID will be used in the creation of the launch template, take a look at the
following code snippet:
1.  aws ec2 describe-images \

2.   --owners amazon --filters 'Name=name,Values=amzn2-ami-hvm-*'
'Name=state,Values=available' \

3.   --query 'sort_by(Images, &CreationDate)[-1].ImageId' \

4.   --region us-east-1 --output text

The output of the above commands gives the following AMI ID:

1.  ami-0806bc468ce3a22ec

Creating a key Execute the provided AWS CLI command to create a key pair
named The output of this command will provide an ASCII version of the
private key and the key fingerprint. It is important to save the private key to a
file as it will be used in the subsequent step when we SSH into the instance
for stress testing. Understand the following code snippet:
1.  aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name My-Key-Pair \

2.   --query 'KeyMaterial' --output text > private-key.pem



---

### Page 576

Creating a Security group for Run the following AWS CLI command below
to create a security group named This security group will manage inbound
and outbound traffic for EC2 instances. Execute the following code:
1.  aws ec2 create-security-group \

2.   --group-name MY-EC2-WEB-SG \

3.   --description "Security group for EC2 Instances" \

4.   --vpc-id my-vpc-id

Execute the following AWS CLI command to enable inbound SSH traffic
from anywhere on port 22 for the above security group:
1.  aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \

2.   --group-id MY-EC2-WEB-SG-ID \

3.   --protocol tcp \

4.   --port 22 \

5.   --cidr 0.0.0.0/0

Creating a script for user Create a shell script and copy the following contents
into it. This script installs and configures the Apache web server and creates a
Hello, World HTML page. We will input this script as part of the lauch-
template-data parameter in the next step during the creation of the launch
template. Execute the following code:
1.  #!/bin/bash

Creating an auto-scaling Execute the following AWS CLI command, which
requires the name of the auto-scaling group, the launch template and version
to use, the minimum and maximum size of the group, the VPC ID, and the
ARN of the target group created in step mentioned in the following code:
1.  aws autoscaling create-auto-scaling-group \

2.   --auto-scaling-group-name MY-ASG \

After creating the auto scaling group with an attached Application Load
Balancer, the load balancer will automatically register new instances as they
come online. Now, navigate to the auto scaling group page of the EC2
console, click on Auto Scaling Groups on the left, and open the auto scaling
group we just created, you will see under the Instances section of the Instance
management tab that our instances are ready to receive the traffic. Initially,
the instances will be in the Pending After a few minutes, the status of
instances will change to InService, as shown in Figure


Figure 7.25: Status transition of instances in the auto scaling group from
pending to InService

Stress testing the auto scaling group

In this section we will guide you through the steps to stress test your Auto
Scaling group, allowing you to verify the responsiveness and effectiveness of
your system under heavy load. The process consists of four main steps:

1. Adding scaling policy: To add target tracking policy to the auto scaling
group. This policy will adjust the desired capacity of our Auto Scaling group
as required to maintain the average CPU utilization of your instances at 50%,
execute the following AWS CLI command:
1.  aws autoscaling put-scaling-policy \

2.   --policy-name AvgCPUUtilization50Policy \

3.   --auto-scaling-group-name MY-ASG \

4.   --policy-type TargetTrackingScaling \

5.   --target-tracking-configuration "PredefinedMetricSpecification=
{PredefinedMetricType=ASGAverageCPUUtilization},TargetValue=50" \

6.   --estimated-instance-warmup 60

2. Connecting to EC2 Choose one of the EC2 instances and connect to it
using the following command:

1.  ssh -i "private-key.pem" ec2-user@ec2-44-192-16-88.compute-
1.amazonaws.com


---

### Page 585


The above command uses private key file obtained from step 2-b and the
Public IPv4 DNS copied from the instance summary information page.

3. Installing the stress Once the Stress utility is installed on the EC2 instance,
run the following command to initiate stress on the EC2 instance:

1.  sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y

2.  sudo yum install stress -y

4. Conducting the stress Once the utility is installed on the EC2 instance, run
the following command to initiate stress on the EC2 instance:

1.  sudo stress --cpu 2 --timeout 600

Approximately, after 10 minutes, the instance count should increase to match
the maximum capacity of the auto scaling group, which is 4, as depicted in
Figure


Figure 7.27: Running EC2 instance to maximum capacity of the auto scaling
group

### Page 586


Lifecycle hook invoking Lambda function

With lifecycle hooks in an Auto Scaling group, we can create custom
solutions that respond to events such as instance launching and instance
terminating in the Auto Scaling lifecycle. A lifecycle hook instructs the Auto
Scaling group to pause for a specified amount of time (default is one hour) to
complete an action before the instance transitions to the next state. Figure
7.28 illustrates the transitions between Auto Scaling instance states:


Figure 7.28: Transitions between Auto Scaling instance states



---

### Page 587

For this use-case, we will use the Auto Scaling group created in a previous
example. We will establish an EventBridge rule that includes an event pattern.
This pattern will match events from the AWS Auto Scaling service when an
EC2 instance is about to be terminated. Upon successful matching of events,
a Lambda function is invoked as the rule target. This Lambda function
performs a custom action: it creates an AMI when an instance is about to be
terminated. The Lambda function also provides a callback to allow the
instance’s lifecycle to proceed if the custom action is successful.

Follow the step-by-step instructions provided below to execute this use-case
in your AWS environment:

Two policies are attached to this role: AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole and
inline policies AutoScalingLifecyclePolicy and The former is a managed
AWS policy that allows our Lambda function to write logs to The latter two
are custom inline policies allowing our Lambda function to complete
lifecycle actions on specified Auto Scaling groups and create an AMI,
respectively.

Make a note of the ARN of the newly created IAM role. This will be needed
in the next step when we set up the Lambda function, which performs the
custom action of generating an AMI, as shown in the following code snippet:
1.  arn:aws:iam::
[AWS_ACCOUNT_ID]:role/EC2LifecycleHookLambdaRole


---

### Page 592


2. Creating the Lambda In this section, we will write the Python code,
package it, and create the Lambda function. This function, once triggered,
will create an AMI from the instance about to be terminated and ensure that
the lifecycle action continues in the Auto Scaling group.

b.  Create a deployment package named lifecycle_hook_lambda.zip using the
following command:

1.  zip lifecycle_hook_lambda.zip lifecycle_hook_lambda.py

c.  Execute the following command to create lambda function named

1.  aws lambda create-function --function-name lifecycle_hook_lambda \

2.  --zip-file fileb://lifecycle_hook_lambda.zip --handler
lifecycle_hook_lambda.lambda_handler --runtime python3.9 \

3.  --role arn:aws:iam::
[ACCOUND_ID]:role/EC2LifecycleHookLambdaRole \

4.  --timeout 300

following step when we add this function as the target of the event bridge
rule:



---

### Page 595

1.  arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:

3. Establishing an EventBridge In this section, we will establish an
EventBridge rule to monitor EC2 termination events within the Auto Scaling
Group. Additionally, we will link our Lambda function as the target of this
rule, allowing it to respond to and handle these events. The steps are as
follows:

a.  Create a Run the following AWS CLI command to establish an
EventBridge rule named This rule listens for EC2 termination events in the
Auto Scaling Group, executes the following code snippet:

1.  aws events put-rule \

2.   --name 'ASGTerminateLifecycleEventRule' \

3.   --event-pattern '{

In conclusion, this hands-on example demonstrated how to leverage AWS
services to automate instance management. By using AWS Auto Scaling
lifecycle hooks and AWS Lambda, we created a system that automatically
creates an AMI of an EC2 instance just before it is terminated, thereby
ensuring we have a snapshot of the instance state for any future requirements.

Conclusion

In this chapter, we started with Amazon Relational Database Service and
its implementation in a Multi-AZ setup. We delved into how RDS ensures
High Availability by synchronously duplicating data between a primary
and standby DB instance in different Availability Zones. This setup
provides a seamless failover mechanism that ensures continuous database
operations even in the event of an infrastructure failure.

Following RDS, we explored Amazon Aurora DB, focusing on its High
Availability capabilities. We established an Aurora MySQL DB cluster
and examined how it maintains data in multiple availability zones for read
scalability and failover protection. Through this, we gained insights into
Aurora’s built-in High Availability feature and how it handles failover
events.

Next, we demonstrated the setup of a scalable and load-balanced
application. We used an Auto Scaling group paired with an Application
Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple robust
Amazon EC2 instances. This enhanced the fault tolerance and scalability
of our application.

Lastly, we learned how to create lifecycle hooks within an Auto Scaling
group. Through a practical demonstration, we learned how these hooks
provide a mechanism to pause and perform custom actions during instance
transitions.

### Page 604


In the next chapter, we will dive into a variety of AWS services. We will
understand termination policies and how to suspend Auto Scaling
processes. We will also investigate content delivery using AWS
CloudFront and ensure High Availability with Route53. Furthermore, we
will explore AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery and the AWS Elastic
Kubernetes Service. Lastly, we will study advanced features of
DynamoDB, including Streams, DAX, and TTL.


---

### Page 605


Points to remember

• Multi-AZ in RDS and Aurora DB provides High Availability by
duplicating data across multiple Availability Zones. It enhances the
reliability of the system by providing seamless failover capabilities.

• By setting up an Auto Scaling group with an Application Load Balancer,
we can ensure efficient traffic distribution across multiple EC2 instances
in different Availability Zones. This setup enhances the application’s fault
tolerance and scalability.

• Lifecycle Hooks in Auto Scaling allow us to pause the instance states in
an Auto Scaling group to carry out specific tasks. It provides an
opportunity to create custom actions that respond to instance launching
and terminating events in the Auto Scaling lifecycle.


---

### Page 606


Questions

1. What is the advantage of using versioning in AWS launch templates?

2. What lifecycle state does an instance transition to after a lifecycle hook,
applied during the termination stage, has completed its action?

3. How can we test the High Availability of my AWS RDS Postgres
instance?

4. For High Availability, across three Availability Zones, how many copies
of data does Aurora DB maintain?


---

### Page 607


Answers

1. Versioning allows you to maintain various configurations in your AWS
launch templates. It enables you to create, reuse, and delete versions,
providing flexibility in managing your AWS resources.

2. Once the action associated with a lifecycle hook in the termination
stage is completed, the state transitions to

3. You can simulate an Availability Zone failure by rebooting the RDS
instance with the failover option. This forces a failover to a standby
replica in another AZ. Use the following AWS CLI command, replacing
mydbinstance with your instance identifier:

1.  aws rds reboot-db-instance \

2.   --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance \

3.   --force-failover

This test only works with instances that have Multi-AZ support enabled.
This operation causes a brief outage, and it helps confirm your application
can handle AZ failures smoothly.

4. For High Availability across three Availability Zones, Aurora DB
maintains six copies of data.

### Page 610


Introduction

In the previous chapter, Implement High Availability, Scalability, and
Fault we learned how to make our AWS services reliable and scalable. We
explored key concepts such as RDS Multi-AZ for database failover,
Aurora DB for high availability, and how to create a scalable, load-
balanced application. We also looked at how to use lifecycle hooks to
trigger Lambda Functions.

In this chapter, we expand on some topics from the previous chapter and
dive deeper into the disaster recovery strategies on AWS. We will start by
learning more about managing Auto Scaling Groups, including how to
suspend operations, and set termination policies. We will also delve
further into AWS DynamoDB, exploring its Streams, the Accelerator
(DAX), and it is Time to Live feature.

Then, we will shift our focus to disaster recovery. We will learn how to
replicate data across different regions using S3 Cross-Region Replication
to improve data durability. We will also discuss how to deploy web
applications on AWS EKS and design a disaster recovery strategy with
AWS DRS. We will discover how to ensure high availability with
CloudFront Origin Failover and Route 53. Another key topic we’ll discuss
is scaling resources based on AWS SQS. By the end of this chapter, you
will have a comprehensive understanding of how to design and automate
disaster recovery strategies on AWS.

Objectives

In this chapter, our main objective is to delve deeply into the design and
automation of disaster recovery strategies on AWS. Through practical
approaches, we will learn how to manage data replication across regions
with S3 Cross-Region Replication, deploy web applications using AWS
EKS, and design robust disaster recovery strategies with AWS DRS. We
will also explore how to ensure high availability using CloudFront Origin
Failover and Route 53. By scaling resources based on AWS SQS, we will
see how to maintain service availability even under heavy loads. By the
end of this chapter, you will have developed a comprehensive
understanding of these critical AWS features and services, empowering
you to create applications that are not only resilient but also capable of
quick recovery in the face of disasters.

### Page 614


Suspend auto scaling processes

Suspending auto scaling processes can be beneficial in specific situations. Let
us assume you are encountering issues with your instances or applications
that require troubleshooting. Suspending auto-scaling processes allows you to
maintain a stable environment, ensuring that your configuration remains
constant during the investigation.

Keep in mind that suspending Auto Scaling Processes is typically a temporary
measure. These processes should be resumed once the required task is
completed, ensuring your application can continue to scale and meet demand
as necessary.

In this example, we will utilize the Auto Scaling group named MY-ASG that
was created in the previous chapter Implementing High Availability,
Scalability, and Fault Tolerance under the Setting Up a Scalable and Load-
Balanced Application section.

Figure 8.1 displays the types of processes that can be suspended or resumed
in an Auto Scaling group:



---

### Page 615


Figure 8.1: Auto scaling processes that can be suspended or resumed

To suspend the specific process AddToLoadBalancer for the Auto Scaling
Group named MY-ASG, execute the following command:

1.  aws autoscaling suspend-processes \

2.   --auto-scaling-group-name MY-ASG \

3.   --scaling-processes AddToLoadBalancer \

4.   --region us-east-1

See Figure 8.2 for a visual representation of this configuration in the
advanced settings of your Auto Scaling group:



---

### Page 616


Figure 8.2: Suspending AddToLoadBalancer Process

To resume the AddToLoadBalancer process for the Auto Scaling group
named allowing new instances to be added to the load balancer as usual, run
this command:

1.  aws autoscaling resume-processes \

2.   --auto-scaling-group-name MY-ASG \

3.   --scaling-processes AddToLoadBalancer \

4.   --region us-east-1

If you need to manually add specific instances to the load balancer that were
launched while the AddToLoadBalancer process was suspended, here’s how:

1.  aws elbv2 register-targets \

2.   --target-group-arn  MY-ALB-TG-ARN \

3.   --targets Id=instance-id-1 Id=instance-id-2 \


---

### Page 617


4.   --region us-east-1

This command requires the ARN of your target group, and instance-id-1 and
instance-id-2 are placeholders for the actual instance IDs that you want to
register. Multiple instance IDs can be specified as needed. Executing this
command will manually register the specified instances with the target group,
allowing the load balancer to direct traffic to these instances.


---

### Page 618


Termination policies in auto scaling group

The termination policy in AWS Auto Scaling determines which instances
to terminate when scaling in or during manual termination. It allows us to
define the rules for selecting instances for termination based on various
criteria. By configuring the termination policy, we can control how
instances are selected to be terminated, ensuring optimal resource
utilization and application availability. There are two types of termination
polices available: predefined and custom. In Figure we can observe the
Predefined termination policies used to select instances during scale-in
events:


Figure 8.3: Termination policies for Instance Selection during Scale-in

To configure termination policies using the AWS CLI, we can leverage the
update-auto-scaling-group command:



---

### Page 619

1.  aws autoscaling update-auto-scaling-group \

2.   --auto-scaling-group-name MY-ASG \

3.   --termination-policies "OldestLaunchTemplate" "Default" \

4.   --region us-east-1

By executing this command, we can modify the termination policy of the
Auto Scaling group named MY-ASG to include the Default and
OldestLaunchTemplate policies.

It is crucial to choose an appropriate termination policy that aligns with
your application’s requirements and workload characteristics. Regularly
reviewing and adjusting the termination policy ensures efficient resource
management and maintains application availability within your AWS Auto
Scaling environment.

Additionally, with AWS Lambda, we have the flexibility to create custom
termination policies that can be invoked by AWS EC2 Auto Scaling
invokes in response to certain events.

S3 Cross-Region Replication

Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication is a feature at the bucket level that
enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across buckets in
different AWS Regions. Buckets configured for cross-region replication
can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts.

CRR in Amazon S3 has several use cases. It meets compliance
requirements by replicating data over geographical distances, reduces
latency by positioning data closer to global users, and supports operational
strategies by enabling disaster recovery backups and the creation of data
lakes in various regions.

In this example, we will demonstrate how to set up cross-region
replication of S3 buckets using AWS CLI. The flow of data replication
from source the bucket to the destination bucket is shown in Figure


Figure 8.4: Cross-region replication flow between source and destination
buckets

will serve as the origin for object replication. The Destination Bucket situated
in the us-west-2 region, will be the target for the replicated objects.

1. Enable versioning on both Versioning must be enabled for both the source
and destination buckets. Run the following AWS CLI command to enable
versioning on the source bucket:
1.  aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \

2.   --bucket my-source-bucket123 \

3.   --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled

Deploy a web application on AWS EKS

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service is a fully managed service that allows
seamless deployment, scaling, and management of containerized
applications using Kubernetes, a popular open-source automation system.
With EKS, users can focus on application development, without worrying
about the overhead of setting up and maintaining their own Kubernetes
control plane or nodes.

In this example, we will learn how to deploy a web application on an
Amazon EKS cluster. First, we will create an EKS cluster using the
command-line tool eksctl. Following that, we will deploy our application,
and Nginx server, onto the EKS cluster using a Kubernetes Deployment. To
expose our application to the outside world, we will then create a Kubernetes
Service of type LoadBalancer, which automatically provisions an Amazon
ELB. Once everything is set up, we will validate the service by checking the
application’s accessibility via the LoadBalancer’s URL. Finally, to ensure
the robustness of our setup, we will simulate a node failure by terminating a
node, demonstrating the high availability of our EKS cluster. The
architecture of this use case is displayed in Figure



---

### Page 635


Figure 8.10: Architectural overview of web application deployment on AWS
## EKS

Please follow the step-by-step instructions below in your AWS CloudShell
environment to complete this use-case:


---

### Page 636


Prerequisites

Ensure that eksctl is installed on your AWS CloudShell. Note that AWS CLI
and kubectl should already be installed on AWS CloudShell.

1. Configure EKS In this step, we will use eksctl to create our EKS cluster.
We will specify the cluster name, region, availability zones, node group
name, node type, and the minimum, maximum, and desired number of nodes.
The --managed flag indicates that we are creating a managed node group.

Execute the following command to create EKS cluster:
1.  eksctl create cluster \

2.   --name eks-cluster \

3.   --region us-east-1 \

4.   --zones us-east-1a,us-east-1b,us-east-1c \

5.   --nodegroup-name eks-workers \

6.   --node-type t3.medium \

7.   --nodes 3 \

8.   --nodes-min 3 \



---

### Page 637

9.   --nodes-max 6 \

10.   --managed

It will take several minutes, up to 15-20 minutes, to create the cluster. Once it
is complete, we can check the status of the cluster by navigating to the EKS
console. Figure 8.11 displays the status of the EKS cluster as

Execute the following command to create the deployment, which will in turn
create three pods running the nginx server:
1.  kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml

Once the deployment is created, you can check the status of the pods by
running the following command:
1.  kubectl get pods -l app=nginx

Figure 8.12 displays the status of all three running pods:

The above service will expose the nginx deployment on a LoadBalancer
created automatically by AWS EKS.

Execute the following command to create the LoadBalancer Service:
1.  kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml

Once the service is created, you can check the status of service by running the
following command:
1.  kubectl get svc nginx-service

it through an external IP or DNS name. You can check the EXTERNAL-IP
field in the output of the kubectl get svc command to get the DNS name of
the LoadBalancer.

Open the URL in a web browser to access your application as shown in

5. Test the High Availability of the First, identify the nodes where your
application pods are running by executing the following command:



---

### Page 642

1.  kubectl get pods -l app=nginx -o wide

The above command will produce an output similar to what is shown in
Figure


Figure 8.15: Running application PODs

Next, navigate to the EKS Console and select the Node for which you are
simulating a failure. To do this, select the EKS cluster that you created, then
choose the Compute tab and click on any Node. Figure 8.16 displays the
instance ID of the selected node:


Figure 8.16: Instance ID of Selected Node in EKS Console

Take the instance-id that you copied earlier and replace it in the following
command to terminate the instance:

1.  aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids


---

### Page 643


After you have terminated the node, AWS EKS will automatically replace the
terminated instance will a new one. This can be observed in the EC2
instances list. You can also confirm this at the Kubernetes level by running:

1.  kubectl get nodes

The output of the command will produce the output as shown in Figure


Figure 8.17: New Node in Cluster After Termination and Replacement

The above output lists all the nodes in your cluster, which should be three.
You should see a new node replacing the one that was terminated, which
confirms that high availability is correctly set up.

Disaster Recovery with AWS DRS

Before diving into AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery it is important to
understand various disaster recovery strategies, as the chosen approach
depends on your specific business requirements and the criticality of your
applications. Here is an overview of these strategies:
• Backup and In this DR strategy data is regularly backed up and restored in
case of a disaster. While this approach is cost-effective, it might lead to higher
Recovery Time Objectives and Recovery Point Objectives

• Pilot In this strategy, a minimal version of the environment is always
running in the cloud. This pilot light contains the core elements needed to
quickly scale up to a fully operational environment when needed.

• Warm This strategy involves a scaled-down version of a fully functional
environment always running in the cloud.

• This strategy deploys a full-scale, fully operational environment in two
locations (typically, different AWS regions) that run simultaneously.

Please refer to Figure which visually represents the different disaster recovery
strategies mentioned above:



---

### Page 645


Figure 8.18: Comparative Overview of Disaster Recovery Strategies

AWS DRS provides a simplified, cost-effective, and reliable method to
minimize downtime and data loss during a disaster. By leveraging this
service, organizations can reduce the complexities involved in traditional
disaster recovery solutions, significantly reducing cost and effort while still
achieving the desired RTOs and RPOs.

DRS continuously replicates the system state, which includes server system
settings, network configurations, and application settings from your primary
environment into a cost-efficient staging area within your AWS account. DRS
uses Pilot Light strategy, is always ready to rapidly provision a full-scale
production environment when disaster strikes.

High Availability with CloudFront origin failover

AWS CloudFront ensures high availability and consistent responses,
facilitated by ample network bandwidth and a multiplexed infrastructure.
Moreover, the reliability of our application can be enhanced using an Origin
Group provided by CloudFront. For instance, we can create an origin group
consisting of two origins: primary and secondary. If the primary origin
becomes unavailable or unresponsive, CloudFront will automatically switch
from the primary to the secondary origin.

The concept is illustrated in the architecture diagram displayed in Figure



---

### Page 648


Figure 8.20: Architecture diagram of CloudFront origin failover

CloudFront requires at least two origins for origin failover. We will create an
Origin Group for the distribution, which will include two origins. Finally, we
update the cache behavior to use the origin group. In this example, we will
leverage the CloudFront distribution that was created in the section named
CloudFormation Nested Stacks Pipeline in Chapter Infrastructure as Code
using CloudFormation and configure origin failover. If the S3 bucket, which
hosts the static contents for the website, is not responding. CloudFront will
serve the static content seamlessly through secondary origin.

Please follow the step-by-steps instructions below to complete the use-case
on your AWS account.


---

### Page 649


Create Secondary S3 Run the following command using AWS CLI and create
an S3 bucket named
1.  aws s3api create-bucket \

2.   --bucket cfn-static-website-failover \

3.   --region us-east-1

Upload file to secondary S3 First, create an HTML file named index.html

Once you have saved this file, upload it to the S3 bucket created in the
previous step using the AWS CLI command:
1.  aws s3 cp index.html s3://cfn-static-website-failover/

This command copies the index.html file from your local directory to the
specified S3 bucket named

Create secondary origin: In this step, we create a secondary origin on the
CloudFront distribution using the failover S3 bucket created in Step Enter
cfn-static-website-failover.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com for the Origin
domain and S3OriginSecondary as the Origin For Origin select Legacy access
identities and choose the previously created Origin Access Identity from the
Origin Access identity dropdown menu. In Bucket select update the bucket
policy. Finally, click on Create as depicted in Figure

Create Origin In this step, we will create an Origin Group from the Origin
created in the previous step. Navigate to the CloudFront origin tab and click
on Origin Select the S3-mywebsite-CloudFrontStack-* origin that was
created in Chapter Infrastructure as Code using which will act as the primary
origin. Then, select the origin created in the last step, named which will act as
the secondary origin. Name the origin group Choose 403 Forbidden and 404
Not Found for the Failover and then click on Create Origin as shown in
Figure

Figure default Cache behavior

In this step, we will perform an origin failover test. Firstly, run the following
command to check the HTTP response from the CloudFront endpoint:
1.  $ curl https://[CloudFront-Domain-Name]

The output of the above command returns following HTML response coming
from the primary origin:
1.

Now, go to the S3 console, access the cfn-static-website S3 bucket, and
rename the object named index.html to Then, run the following command:
1.  aws cloudfront create-invalidation \

2.   --distribution-id [CloudFront-Distribution-Id] \

3.   --paths "/index.html"

The create-invalidation command invalidates the index.html file in the
edge caches. Consequently, the next time a viewer requests this file,
CloudFront returns to the origin to fetch the latest version of the file.

After renaming the file, when the user accesses the CloudFront
distribution, index.html will be served from the secondary origin. To
check if CloudFront has switched to the secondary origin, use the curl
command again:


---

### Page 657

1.  curl https://[CloudFront-Domain-Name]

The HTML response from the CloudFront distribution should now be:

This new response indicates that CloudFront has successfully switched to
the secondary origin, as the primary origin’s index.html file has been
renamed.

Disaster recovery in AWS DynamoDB

DynamoDB Streams feature in AWS DynamoDB enables the capture of a
time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table.
This information, which includes data about every insertion, modification,
and deletion performed on the table, is stored in a log for up to 24 hours.
Applications can access this log, allowing them to observe the state of data
items before and after modifications, in a near real-time manner.

Another important feature of DynamoDB is the Global Table, which
seamlessly replicates data across AWS regions. Two features can be leveraged
to create Disaster Recovery Plan. In this example, we will learn how to
replicate DynamoDB tables in other AWS regions. The architecture of the
use-case is shown in Figure


Figure 8.24: Cross-Region Replication of AWS DynamoDB Tables

Please follow the step-by-step instructions below in your AWS environment
to complete this use-case:


---

### Page 661


1. Create a DynamoDB Use the following AWS CLI command to create a
new table named employee in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) region:
1.  aws dynamodb create-table \

2.   --table-name employee \

3.   --attribute-definitions \

4.       AttributeName=emp_id,AttributeType=N \

5.       AttributeName=emp_name,AttributeType=S \

6.   --key-schema \

7.       AttributeName=emp_id,KeyType=HASH \

8.       AttributeName=emp_name,KeyType=RANGE \

9.   --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST \

10.   --stream-specification
StreamEnabled=true,StreamViewType=NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES \

11.   --region us-east-1

2. Create a Replica Run the following command using AWS CLI to create a
similar table named employee in Oregon (us-west-2) region:


---

### Page 662


1.  aws dynamodb update-table --table-name employee --cli-input-json --
region us-east-1 \

2.     '{

3.         "ReplicaUpdates":

4.         [

5.             {

6.             "Create": {

7.                 "RegionName": "us-west-2"

8.                 }

9.             }

10.         ]

11.     }'

3. Put sample Run the following command using AWS CLI to put a single
item in the employee table in N. Virginia (us-east-1) region:

1.  aws dynamodb put-item \


---

### Page 663


2.   --table-name employee \

3.   --item '{"emp_id": {"N": "1"}, "emp_name": {"S": "John Doe"}}' \

4.   --region us-east-1

A different item in the Oregon (us-west-2) region by running the following
command:
1.  aws dynamodb put-item \

2.     --table-name employee \

3.     --item '{"emp_id": {"N": "2"}, "emp_name": {"S": "Jane Doe"}}' \

4.     --region us-west-2

4. Execute the following commands and observe that the output of both
commands is the same:

1.  aws dynamodb scan --table-name employee --region us-east-1

2.  aws dynamodb scan --table-name employee --region us-west-2

This concludes that bidirectional replication from N. Virginia (us-east-1) to
Oregon (us-west-2) and vice versa is operational.

DynamoDB Accelerator

DynamoDB Accelerator is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory
cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10x performance improvement. It
reduces the response time from milliseconds to microseconds, even under
heavy load. It is easy to simply provision the DAX client SDK, direct your
existing DynamoDB API calls at the DAX cluster, and let DAX handle the
rest.

DAX is particularly beneficial in the following usecases:

• Real-time This includes scenarios such as gaming, trading, and bidding,
which require the fastest response times for reads. In such situations, DAX
delivers high-speed, in-memory read performance.

• Caching frequently accessed If an application repeatedly reads the same
data, DAX can cache that data and serve it quickly, thereby reducing the load
on the DynamoDB table.

It is worth noting that DAX is specifically designed to boost the performance
of read-intensive applications. Write-intensive applications may not see the
same level of performance improvement.

Figure 8.25 displays the high-lever overview of DAX:

### Page 666


DynamoDB Time to Live

The Time to Live feature in AWS DynamoDB allows us to define a
timestamp for each item to determine when it is no longer needed. After
the date and time of the specified timestamp pass, DynamoDB will delete
the item from the table. This feature helps save storage costs by
automating the deletion of outdated items or items that lose relevance after
a specified time, such as user session data.

In this example, we will use the employee table created in the N. Virginia
(us-east-1) region under Disaster Recovery in AWS DynamoDB in this
chapter.

Please follow the step-by-step instructions below in your AWS
environment to complete this use-case:

1. Enable In this step, we enable TTL on the employee table for the ttl
attribute:
1.  aws dynamodb update-time-to-live \

2.   --table-name employee \

3.   --time-to-live-specification "Enabled=true, AttributeName=ttl" \

4.   --region us-east-1



---

### Page 667

2. Insert an item: Now, we will insert an employee with a TTL value. The
TTL value is a UNIX timestamp, representing the number of seconds
since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. Here we will insert an employee record
that will expire after 5 minutes:

1.  aws dynamodb put-item \

2.   --table-name employee \

3.   --item '{

4.       "emp_id": {"N": "3"},

5.       "emp_name": {"S": "Temporary Employee"},

6.       "ttl": {"N": "'$(($(date +%s) + 300))'"}

7.     }' \

8.   --region us-east-1

3. Now, if you wait for about 5 minutes and then run the scan command,
you will notice that the temporary employee record would have been
automatically deleted:

1.  aws dynamodb scan --table-name employee --region us-east-1


---

Scaling based on Simple Queue Service

Using the AWS Simple Queue Service to scale an AWS EC2 auto scaling
group is a popular design pattern used to decouple and scale microservices,
distributed systems, and serverless applications. The three crucial key
components necessary important to setup this configuration are as follows:

Configure an auto scaling group to manage EC2 instances that will process
messages coming from an SQS queue.

Establish a custom metric to be sent to CloudWatch, measuring the number of
messages in the queue per EC2 instance within Auto Scaling group.

Setup a target tracking scaling policy that configures the Auto Scaling group
to adjust its scaling capacity based on the custom metric and a predetermined
target value.

Figure 8.26 illustrates the architecture of this usecase:

High Availability with Route 53

Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System web
service offered by AWS. This service is not only used for domain registration
but also for DNS routing and health checking of resources. Some
organizations, due to regulatory requirements, aim to expand their business
into additional AWS regions. They utilize an active-active or active-standby
disaster recovery configuration using the health-checking capabilities of
Route 53.

In active-passive failover configuration, we aim for the primary resources to
be available most of the time and for secondary resources to be on standby in
case the primary resources become unavailable. If Route 53 detects that the
primary resources as unhealthy, it will include healthy secondary resources in
response to DNS queries. Figure 8.27 illustrates an active-passive failover
configuration with Route 53 DNS failover:

AWS Auto Scaling

AWS Auto Scaling service monitors our applications and automatically
adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest
possible cost. This service allows us to build scaling plans for various
resources including AWS EC2 instances, AWS ECS tasks, AWS DynamoDB
tables, and Aurora Replicas. It automatically removes unneeded resources to
prevent overspending. It also uses historical load metrics to understand our
application’s usage pattern and proactively scales resources ahead of time.
Currently, this feature is only available for EC2 Auto Scaling groups. Figure
8.28 illustrates how AWS Auto Scaling service can discover EC2 Auto
Scaling groups automatically:

Conclusion

In this chapter, we learned how to suspend processes and apply
termination policies. This equipped us with better control over the
lifecycle of instances within our groups.

We then turned our attention to AWS’s disaster recovery strategies. We
delved into S3 Cross-Region Replication, a powerful feature that enhances
data durability across multiple geographical regions, ensuring robust
disaster recovery. We learned how to deploy web applications on AWS
EKS and designed a disaster recovery plan with AWS Disaster Recovery
Service We also explored the high availability configurations provided by
CloudFront’s Origin Failover and Route 53, giving us mechanisms to
minimize service interruptions and ensure a resilient application
environment. We touched upon resource scaling using AWS SQS, further
empowering our ability to handle fluctuating loads efficiently. Through
this focused exploration, we are now well equipped to design and
automate disaster recovery strategies on AWS.

Points to remember

• Suspending Auto Scaling processes is useful for troubleshooting, but it
should be a temporary measure and resumed once issues are resolved.

• The termination policy in Auto Scaling groups influences which
instances are terminated during scaling in or manual termination.

• Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication enables automatic copying of
objects to different AWS Regions, useful for compliance, reducing
latency, and disaster recovery.

• Amazon EKS allows seamless deployment of web applications, with
high availability demonstrated by terminating a node in an EKS cluster.

• Various disaster recovery strategies in AWS include Backup and Restore,
Pilot Light, Warm Standby, and Multi-Site configurations.

• AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery Service (DRS) offers different strategies
like Backup and Restore, Pilot Light, Warm Standby, and Multi-Site,
depending on business needs and application criticality.

• DynamoDB Streams and Global Tables facilitate disaster recovery
planning by capturing item-level modifications and replicating data across
regions.

Questions

1. How do you set up CloudFront for high availability using origin
failover?

2. What is Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and what performance
improvement does it offer?

3. What is AWS Auto Scaling and its main advantage?


---

### Page 677


Answers

1. To set up CloudFront for high availability, create an origin group
consisting of two origins - a primary and a secondary. CloudFront
automatically switches to the secondary origin if the primary origin
becomes unavailable or returns specific HTTP response status codes
indicating a failure. This setup ensures uninterrupted service and high
availability for your content delivery.

2. Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully managed, highly
available caching service specifically designed for Amazon DynamoDB. It
provides up to a 10 times performance improvement, reducing response
times from milliseconds to microseconds, even under millions of requests
per second. This makes DAX an ideal solution for applications requiring
high-speed data access.

3. AWS Auto Scaling automatically adjusts your application’s capacity for
optimal performance and cost efficiency. It supports various AWS
resources like EC2 instances and DynamoDB tables, ensuring your
applications have the right resources when needed.

Introduction

Domain-1, SDLC Automation, was discussed in Chapter Continuous
Integration with CodeCommit and Code Build, Chapter Continuous
Delivery with CodeDeploy and CodePipeline, and Chapter Cross-Account
CI/CD Pipelines and Testing. In this domain, we implemented continuous
integration and continuous delivery DevOps practices using AWS
CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy and CodePipeline.

Domain-2, Configuration Management and IaC, was elaborated in
Chapter Infrastructure as Code using Chapter Automation Account
Management and Security in AWS, and Chapter 6: Automation using
OpsWorks and Elastic Beanstalk. In this domain, we learned about best
deployment strategies and practices such as rolling, blue/green, and canary
using AWS Lambda and AWS SAM. We used AWS Infrastructure as Code
Service extensively, particularly CloudFormation, in numerous examples
to provision resources in the AWS environment.

Domain-3, Resilient Cloud Solutions, was the focus of Chapter Implement
High Availability, Scalability, and Fault Tolerance and Chapter 8: Design
and Automate Disaster Recovery Strategies. In this domain, we learned
how to implement highly available and scalable solutions to meet
resilience and business requirements. We also explored automated
recovery processes to meet RTO/RPO requirements. This chapter, and the
following chapter, will delve into Domain-4 of the exam, Monitoring and
Logging. In this chapter, we will explore AWS CloudWatch, CloudTrail,
EventBridge, and VPC Flow logs.


---

### Page 680


Structure

In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:
• Implementing custom AWS CloudWatch Metrics

• Implementing AWS CloudWatch logs subscription filter with lambda

• AWS EventBridge integration with SNS

• AWS CloudTrail integration with CloudWatch

• Publish VPC Flow Logs to S3 and Query in Athena


---

### Page 681


Objectives

In this chapter, we will focus on enhancing monitoring and logging in
AWS. We aim to understand how to create custom CloudWatch Metrics
and use Lambda with CloudWatch Logs Subscription Filter. We will
explore how to integrate AWS CloudTrail with CloudWatch for improved
tracking, and how to use AWS EventBridge with SNS for event-driven
applications. Additionally, we will learn to publish VPC Flow Logs to S3
and use Athena for querying these logs. By the end of the chapter, you will
have a solid understanding of these AWS services and how to utilize them
for effective log management and event-driven computing in AWS.


---

### Page 682


Implementing Custom AWS CloudWatch Metrics

In this example, we will use AWS SAM to deploy a lambda function. This
function will take values from the invocation event and insert custom metric
data in CloudWatch. The architecture diagram for this solution is shown in
Figure


Figure 9.1: Lambda publishes custom metric data in CloudWatch

Before we start working on this use case, let us refresh our knowledge by
reviewing key concepts about CloudWatch Metrics:
• Namespaces are used to isolate the different application and service metrics
in CloudWatch. It helps in organizing and grouping related metrics together.

• It allows us to collect, track and store data about AWS resources or
applications which we run in AWS. It helps in gaining insight about the
performance of resources and applications in AWS over time.



---

### Page 683

• This is a name/value pair which uniquely identities a metric.

• It can be set to one minute or one second and is used in determining the
frequency by which data point can be stored in metric. Higher resolution
helps in detailed analysis and troubleshooting of any issue, but it incurs more
charges.

• It is used in doing mathematical calculation on metric data for instance sum,
minimum, average etc.

• Each statistics has a unit of measure, for example bytes, seconds, count, and
percent.

• It allows to set a threshold on metric data and performs a specified action
when the value of the data point crosses the threshold. For instance, we can
set up an alarm if the CPU usage of the EC2 instance is more than 80%, then
scale up the instances using an autoscaling group.

Follow this step-by-step procedure below to complete this exercise on your
AWS account:


---

### Page 684


Prerequisites

AWS SAM is installed and configured.

1. Develop a lambda function: Create an application directory named Under
this directory create a subdirectory named in this subdirectory create a file
named lambda_func.py and copy the following contents:
1.  import boto3

2.

3.  cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch', region_name='aws_region')

4.

5.  def lambdafunc_handler(event, context):

6.

7.     params = {

8.         'MetricData': [],

9.         'Namespace': 'MyMetricNamespace'

10.     }



---

### Page 685

11.

12.     params['MetricData'].append({

13.         'MetricName': 'LatencyByEdgeLocation',

14.         'Dimensions': [

15.             { 'Name': 'EdgeLocation', 'Value': event['LocationCode'] }

16.         ],

17.         'Timestamp': 'Wednesday, Jan 18, 2023 8:28:20 PM',

18.         'Unit': 'Milliseconds',

19.         'Value': event['TimeToFirstByte']

20.     })

21.

22.     print(cloudwatch.put_metric_data(**params))

This lambda function publishes one data point for a new metric named This
data point measures the latency of a web application observed at an edge
location. The data point has an associated timestamp, and it is placed under a
custom namespace named


---

### Page 686


2. Create a SAM Create a YAML file named template.yml inside the
application directory named cloudwatch-custom-metric and copy the
following contents:

1.  AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'

2.  Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31

3.  Description: Lambda to Cloudwatch Demo

4.

5.  Resources:

6.   PutMetricFunction:

7.     Type: AWS::Serverless::Function

8.     Properties:

9.       CodeUri: src/

10.       Handler: lambda_func.lambdafunc_handler

11.       Runtime: python3.9

12.       # SAM Managed Policy for inserting custom CloudWatch Metrics



---

### Page 687

13.       Policies:

14.         - CloudWatchPutMetricPolicy: {}

15.

16.  Outputs:

17.   PutMetricFunction:

18.      Description: "ARN of PutMetricFunction Lambda"

19.     Value: !GetAtt PutMetricFunction.Arn

The directory structure inside the application directory cloudwatch-custom-
metric looks like this now:
1.  ├── src

2.  │  └── lambda_func.py

3.  └── template.yml

4.

3. SAM validate: Run the following command using SAM CLI to check if the
SAM template is valid:

1. sam validate --template-file template.yml


---

### Page 688


4. SAM Run the following command using SAM CLI which creates a
CloudFormation stack named

1.  sam deploy --template-file template.yml \

2.     --stack-name cloudwatch-custom-metric-stack \

3.     --s3-bucket [your-bucket-name] \

4.       --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

The stack creates two resource lambda functions, named PutMetricFunction
and an IAM role named PutMetricFunctionRole as shown in Figure


Figure 9.2: Resources created by CloudFormation in publishing metric in
CloudWatch

5. Testing and Create a test JSON event as mentioned below and supply it to
the lambda function:


---

### Page 689

1.  {

2.   "LocationCode": "XYZ-123",

3.   "TimeToFirstByte": 100

4.  }

After we invoke the lambda function with the above test event, we can view
the published metrics in CloudWatch. Go to the left navigation pane in the
CloudWatch console, choose All choose a custom namespace named
MyMetricNamespace on the right, select a dimension named and choose a
metric named A graph of metric data is displayed with data points highlighted
in Figure

Implementing AWS CloudWatch logs subscription filter with lambda

Subscription filters are mainly used to ingest real-time log events from
CloudWatch logs to other AWS Services, AWS Kinesis stream, AWS Kinesis
Data Firehose stream, or AWS Lambda. Log events are consumed by
receiving service in base64 encoded with gzip format.

Each subscription filter is made of two key elements: log group name and
filter

• Filter Its syntax is like a regular expression. It allows us to filter only those
events which match the pattern defined in the search expression. Only filter
log events are sent to other AWS services such as Lambda, Kinesis stream or
Data Firehose stream.
1.  ?ERROR ?WARN ?5xx

• Log group A subscription filter will be applied to all the log events which
are uploaded to the log group, those that match the filter are delivered to the
destination service.

In this example, we demonstrate how to trigger automated email alerts
whenever unusual activity happens in the logs. The AWS resources for this
use case are deployed using AWS CloudFormation template. The template
creates several resources in AWS such as log group, log stream, lambda
function, lambda execution role, a subscription filter and permission which is
granted to CloudWatch logs to execute the lambda function. The user
generates test log events to a log stream using AWS CLI, CloudWatch

captures the user-entered log events, matches log entries with the filter pattern
defined in CloudWatch Subscription and invokes a lambda function that
parses the errors and in turn publishes these error messages to AWS SNS
topic. SNS topic is subscribed to an email address so that users can receive
email notifications about the errors. The architecture of the solution is shown
in Figure


Figure 9.4: AWS CloudWatch Subscription filter with AWS Lambda

Follow the step-by-step procedure to complete this use case on your AWS
account:


---

### Page 692


Prerequisites

• AWS CLI, AWS SAM installed.

• SNS Use the SNS topic created in Chapter 1 for Creating an AWS
CodeCommit Trigger for an AWS SNS Topic section. Copy the ARN of the
topic as shown below:
1.  arn:aws:sns:[aws-region]: 111111111111:my-sns-topic

Develop a lambda function: In this section, we develop a Lambda function
named lambda_func.py under an application directory named This function is
responsible for processing log events, extracting error details, and sending
email notifications via Amazon SNS. The function takes raw log events
encoded in base64 format, decodes, decompresses, and parses them to extract
key information such as the log group, log stream, lambda function name, and
error messages.

Here is a snippet of the main handler function from
1.  def lambdafunc_handler(event, context):

2.     my_payload = processing_log_events(event)

3.     (

4.         log_group_name,

5.         log_stream_name,



---

### Page 693

6.         lambdafunct_name,

7.         err_message,

8.     ) = processing_err_payload(my_payload)

9.     sending_email_notification(log_group_name, log_stream_name,
lambdafunct_name, err_message)

Please note this is a shortened version of the code from The full function
version of this function, which includes all components and additional error
handling measures, can be found on the GitHub repository for Chapter 9 of
this book.

Finally, to package lambda_func.py and upload the Lambda function to an
Amazon S3 bucket, we use the following commands:
1.  zip lambda_func.zip lambda_func.py

2.  aws s3 cp lambda_func.zip s3://[s3-bucket-name]

Create a CloudFormation template: Create a CloudFormation template named
This template defines the log group with a specified name, a log stream, S3
bucket for lambda code, a lambda function provided in the previous step, a
lambda execution IAM role, a subscription filter and permission to
CloudWatch to execute a lambda function.

In this part of the CloudFormation template, we define several parameters as
shown below:
1.  Parameters:

AWS EventBridge integration with SNS

In this example, we will demonstrate how to create an EventBridge rule that
invokes an SNS topic. We will use AWS SAM to deploy the AWS resources
for this solution.

Before we start working on this use-case, let us refresh our knowledge by
reviewing key concepts about EventBridge. EventBridge was formerly called
CloudWatch Events. EventBridge uses the same CloudWatch Events API,
which means EventBridge is fully backward compatible. EventBridge is a
serverless service that uses events to connect application components together
and makes it easier to build scalable event-drive applications. EventBridge
receives an event (an indicator of change in environment) and applies a rule
to router event to a target. All events that come to EventBridge are associated
with an event bus. The architecture of this use-case is shown in Figure

AWS CloudTrail integration with CloudWatch

CloudTrail can be configured with CloudWatch to monitor our trail logs and
send notifications in case of unusual activity in the logs.

In this example, we will create a CloudTrail trail to push the logs to
CloudWatch. We will setup a CloudWatch logs metric filter to monitor the
AWS Management ConsoleLogin events in the logs. We will assign
CloudWatch metrics to the metric filter. Next, we will create a CloudWatch
alarm that is triggered when there are one or more Console sign-in failure
events observed in the CloudWatch logs in a one-minute time interval. Users
will receive an email notification about the sign-in failure errors.

Before we start working on this use case, let us refresh our knowledge by
reviewing key concepts about CloudTrail:

• CloudTrail An event is the record of an activity in an AWS account.

• Type of events logged in There are three types of events that can be logged
in CloudTrail, which are, management events, data events, and CloudTrail
Insights events. By default, trails log management events, but not data or
insights events.

• A trail is a configuration that enables the delivery of CloudTrail events to an
AWS S3 bucket, CloudWatch Logs, and CloudWatch Events.



---

### Page 713

We will use the AWS SAM template to deploy the resources for this use case.
The architecture of this use case is shown in Figure


Figure 9.11: Architecture diagram of CloudTrail Integration with CloudWatch

Pre-requisite: AWS SAM installed and configured.

Follow this step-by-step procedure to complete this use case on your AWS
account:

1. Create a SAM template: Create an application directory named cloudtrail-
to-cloudwatch and create a YAML file named In this part of the
CloudFormation template, we define several parameters as shown below:
1.  Parameters:


---

### Page 714


2.   CloudTrailName:

4.   CloudTrailLogsBucketName:

5.     Type: String

6.   Email:

7.     Type: String

8.     Description: Email address to notify when an API activity triggers an
alarm

The other part of the SAM template creates a log group which is the delivery
endpoint for log events, an IAM role that enables CloudTrail to send events to
the CloudWatch group, a trail and an S3 bucket to store CloudTrail logs. The
template creates other resources also such as a CloudWatch metric filter with
a filter pattern and a metric named ConsoleSigninFailureCount and a
CloudWatch alarm that is triggered when there are one or more AWS
Management Console sign-in failures during a one-minute period.
1.  { ($.eventName = ConsoleLogin) && ($.errorMessage = "Failed
authentication") }

The complete CloudFormation template can be found in the GitHub
repository associated with Chapter 9 of this book.

### Page 715

2. SAM validate: Run the following command using SAM CLI to check if the
SAM template is valid:

1.  sam validate --template-file template.yml

3. SAM deploy: Run the following command using SAM CLI which creates a
CloudFormation stack named

1.  sam deploy --template-file template.yml \

2.   --stack-name cloudtail-to-cloudwatch-stack  \

Publish VPC Flow Logs to S3 and Query in Athena

VPC flow allows us to capture and log data about network traffic in our VPC.
It helps in networking troubleshooting scenarios where there is a need to
monitor traffic that reaches to EC2 instance and determine the direction of
traffic to and from network interfaces. VPC flow data can be published to
AWS CloudWatch logs, AWS S3 and AWS Kinesis Data Firehose.

In this example, we will demonstrate how to publish VPC flow logs to S3 and
query the data using Athena. Athena is a serverless AWS service which
provides us with the capability to query data from the logs stored in S3 using
SQL. The architecture of this use case is illustrated in Figure

Conclusion

In this chapter, we learned how to implement a Custom CloudWatch
Metric. To achieve this, we used AWS SAM to deploy a Lambda function
that takes values from the invocation event and inserts custom metric data
into CloudWatch. We also showcased how to trigger automated email
alerts when unusual activity is detected in the CloudWatch logs, again
using AWS SAM to create the necessary resources. Additionally, we
demonstrated how to create an EventBridge rule that invokes an SNS
topic and explained the process of integrating AWS CloudTrail with
CloudWatch.

To conclude, we illustrated how to publish VPC Flow Logs to S3 and run
queries on them using Athena. The knowledge acquired in this chapter
will be valuable in the next one, Auditing, Logging, and Monitoring
Containers and where we will explore auditing infrastructure using AWS
Config, AWS Inspector and assessment templates, analyzing logs with
CloudWatch logs insights, remediating issues using AWS Config, and
configuring X-Ray for Lambda.

### Page 729


Points to remember

• AWS VPC Flow Logs allow us to capture information about incoming
and outgoing traffic from network interfaces in the VPC. We can use the
AWS Athena service to analyze these logs, thereby facilitating an
investigation into traffic patterns, threats, and risks associated with our
## VPC.

• Subscription filters are mainly used to ingest real-time log events from
CloudWatch logs to other AWS Services, AWS Kinesis stream, AWS
Kinesis Data Firehose stream, or AWS Lambda.

• EventBridge receives an event and applies a rule to router event to a All
events that come to EventBridge are associated with an event bus.

• There are three types of events that can be logged in CloudTrail, which
are management events, data events, and CloudTrail Insights events. By
default, trails log management events, but not data or insights events.

• CloudWatch Alarm allows us to set a threshold on metric data and
performs a specified action when the value of data point crosses the
threshold.

Integration of AWS X-Ray with Lambda

AWS X-Ray service is used in analyzing and debugging distributed
applications that are built using microservices and serverless architecture. X-
Ray collects trace data from AWS resources and applications and provides
detailed information about the request and response from end to end. It
provides different tools to view, filter and get an insight into the data which
helps developers identify performance issues and improve the performance of
applications.

In this example, we will use AWS infrastructure created in Chapter
Automation using OpsWorks and Elastic Beanstalk, where we learned how to
Build HTTP API using Lambda, DynamoDB and AWS SAM. We created
different resources in AWS as part of the infrastructure such as API Gateway,
Lambda function and DynamoDB table. To keep the example simple, we will
activate the tracing only on the Lambda function. We will generate test traffic
when we hit the API Gateway endpoint and visualize the service map in the
X-Ray Console. The updated architecture diagram for this use case is shown
in Figure

2. Generating test traffic: Generate test traffic by running the following shell
script. This script uses the AWS CloudFormation command to describe-stacks
and retrieves the API Gateway endpoint URL. Script uses this endpoint URL
and makes five PUT requests. It also makes one GET request using the CURL
command, which results in insertion of five product entries in the DynamoDB
table and returns all the existing products from the table.
1.  #!/bin/bash

2.  stack_name="aws-crud-stack"

3.

4.  # Get ApiEndPoint from Cloudformation Outputs

### Page 739


5.  api_endpoint=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name
$stack_name --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?
OutputKey==`ApiEndpoint`].OutputValue' --output text)

6.  echo "API EndPoint is $api_endpoint"

7.

3. Viewing service After generating test traffic, the Lambda function sends
trace data to X-Ray Service, which processes this data to produce a Service
map. To view this map, go to X-Ray console and select the appropriate time
interval for the submitted requests. The resulting graph representation, as
shown in Figure 10.4 displays two nodes: the left node represents the Lambda
service receiving requests from the client, while the right node represents the
Lambda function itself. The service map further indicates the health status of
each node through distinct markers, like green for success, red for server
faults, yellow for client errors, and purple for throttling errors.

4. Viewing Select the right node, the lambda function in service map and
click on view traces as shown above in Figure 10.4, which opens a Trace List
which contains trace IDs. Select the first trace ID to drill down the trace map
and timeline for the trace as shown in Figure 10.5:

Integration of AWS Kinesis Data Stream with Lambda

In this example, we will use AWS SAM which deploys Kinesis Data Stream,
Lambda function and IAM resources. The IAM role will allow Lambda to
read the Kinesis stream and write records to CloudWatch logs. For testing, we
will run a bash script that uses AWS CLI commands which inserts event
records into the Kinesis stream. Lambda polls the data stream and when it
detects that new records are added to the stream, it invokes Lambda function.
The lambda function decodes records in batches from the stream and logs the
records to CloudWatch logs. The architecture of this use case is illustrated in
Figure


Figure 10.6: Architecture diagram of Kinesis data stream Integration with
Lambda and CloudWatch logs


---

### Page 743


Prerequisites

AWS SAM is installed and configured.

1. Creating a Lambda Create an application directory named Under this
directory create a subdirectory named in this subdirectory create a file named
lambda_func.py and copy the following contents:
1.  import base64

2.  def handler(event, context):

3.     for record in event['Records']:

4.         kinesis_decoded_payload=base64.b64decode(record["kinesis"]
["data"])

5.         print("Kinesis decoded payload: " + str(kinesis_decoded_payload))

This lambda function processes records from Kinesis stream in batches,
decodes the logs, and makes entries in the CloudWatch logs.

2. Creating SAM Create a YAML file named template.yml inside application
directory named kinesis-to-lambda and copy the following contents:

1.  AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'

2.  Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31

3. Deploying AWS SAM Run the following command using SAM CLI which
creates CloudFormation stack named


---

### Page 746


1.  sam deploy --template template.yml \

2.   --stack-name kinesis-to-lambda-stack \

3.   --s3-bucket [your_s3_bucket] \

4.   --region us-east-1 \

5.   --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

The stack creates a Kinesis data stream, a lambda function, an
EventSourceMapping and an IAM resource as illustrated in Figure The
EventSourceMapping resource creates a mapping between the Kinesis event
resource and the Lambda function. Lambda reads items from the event source
and triggers the lambda function. The X-Ray tracing is activated on the
Lambda function.

stream. The --data option specified in the command is a string which is
encoded by AWS CLI to base64 before sending to Kinesis:
1.  #!/bin/bash

2.  stack_name="kinesis-to-lambda-stack"

3.

4.  stream_name=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name
$stack_name --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs[?

Analyzing CloudWatch logs data in CloudWatch Logs Insights

CloudWatch Logs Insights provides the capability to search and analyze data
from log groups using its built-in query language. Using CloudWatch Insights
we can write simple commands and queries to retrieve meaningful
information from the CloudWatch logs that helps in troubleshooting
operational or production issues.

In this example, we construct a query using the filter command which returns
log events and displays them in descending order from the log group named
In the filter command, we put a condition to display only those log events that
match the string named Kinesis decoded The query used and returned log
events in Logs Insight are shown in Figure

CloudWatch log retention

By default, data in CloudWatch log groups is stored for an indefinite
amount of time. We can configure the retention policy to the specified
number of days which reduces the storage and cost incurred towards the
CloudWatch service. Any data in log groups which is older than the
retention setting is removed automatically.

In this example, we will use the AWS CLI command to set the retention of
a log group.


---

### Page 753


Prerequisites

Run the following bash script on your terminal. This script creates a log
group, creates a log stream in a specified log group and puts sample log
events to the stream:

1.  #!/bin/bash

2.

3.  # CloudWatch log group name

4.  loggroup="test-log-group"

5.

6.  # CloudWatch log stream name

7.  logstream="test-log-stream"

Configuring encryption of log data

By default, CloudWatch log data at rest is encrypted with AWS server-side
encryption. For compliance reasons, it is possible to encrypt the newly
created or existing log group with an AWS KMS customer-managed key. If
we revoke or delete the KMS key associated with the log group, we will not
be able to access encrypted data from the CloudWatch log group.

In this example, we will create an AWS KMS customer managed key and
associate it with the log group created in the previous example. The step-by-
step procedure is as follows:

Create an AWS KMS the Key Management Service console, and configure
Symmetric key with an alias shown in Figure



---

### Page 759


Figure Customer Managed Key in Key Management Service

Note down the ARN of the kms key created:

KMS Key ARN:
1.  arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:111111111111:key/8c58d6b7-e0ca-4c60-950e-
33d13d89ba58

Also, note down the ARN of the log group created in the previous example:



---

### Page 760

Log group ARN:
1.

Set permissions on the KMS key: In this step , we authorize CloudWatch
Logs service principal to use the KMS key. To do this, edit the key policy for
the created kms key and add the following policy block:
1.  {

2.             "Effect": "Allow",

3.             "Principal": {

4.                 "Service": "logs.region.amazonaws.com"

5.             },

19.         }

Associate a KMS key with a log group: In this step, we will associate the
KMS key created in Step 1 with the previously created log group. Execute the
following AWS CLI command to associate the KMS CMK with a log group
named as depicted in Figure
1.  aws logs associate-kms-key --log-group-name test-log-group \

Running security assessment on EC2 using AWS Inspector

AWS Inspector is used to check the security vulnerabilities of applications
running on EC2 instances. It performs a security assessment against the
best practices and produces a details report if there are deviations.

In this example, we use AWS SAM to create a resource group, assessment
target, and assessment template resources. The resource group uses tags to
find the EC2 instance which needs to be selected in the assessment target.
Further, the assessment target uses the ARN of the resource group. SAM
template also creates an assessment template by using the ARN of the
assessment target and ARN of the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
rules package deployed in us-east-1 region.


---

### Page 764

Prerequisites

To prepare for a security assessment on EC2 using AWS Inspector, ensure
that your EC2 instance is configured with the necessary tag and that the AWS
Inspector agent is installed on it.

For guidance on installing the AWS Inspector Classic agent, refer to the AWS
documentation:

Configuring AWS Config rule to remediate an issue

AWS Config provides the ability to record the configuration changes of
provisioned resources in the AWS account over time. The important use cases
of AWS Config are resource administration, auditing, compliance, and
security analysis of the AWS resources.

In this example, we will deploy an AWS-managed Config rule. This rule
evaluates if standard logging in CloudFront is enabled. We will configure an
Event Bridge rule that will trigger a notification to SNS topic when
CloudFront resource is found to be non-compliant. The config rule is
configured with an auto-remediation feature which means AWS Config
continuously monitors non-compliance CloudFront distribution and executes
AWS System Manager Automation document or Runbook. The runbook
updates CloudFront distribution by enabling standard logging.

The architecture of this use case is shown in Figure

### Page 773

Prerequisites

In the prerequisites, we’ll activate AWS Config Service, create an SNS topic,
utilize an existing CloudFront distribution, create an IAM role with a specific
policy, and set up an S3 bucket for CloudFront access logs. Each step
prepares the AWS environment for subsequent configurations and
implementations.

• Activating AWS config Ensure AWS Service is enabled, and configuration
recording is turned on in AWS account.

• Creating SNS Ensure the SNS topic is created in the same region where the
AWS Config service is configured. Following is the ARN of the SNS topic
created in Chapter
1.  arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111111111111:my-sns-topic

• Creating CloudFront distribution: We will use the CloudFront distribution
created in Chapter 3 as part of the section Continuous delivery pipeline for
AWS CloudFormation Nested Stacks. In that section, we learned how to
deploy a static website hosted in an S3 bucket and served by CloudFront
distribution.

Following is the CloudFront distribution ID that we use for this example:
1.  arn:aws:cloudfront::111111111111:distribution/ET65WQCIUL29M

• Create an IAM Role: Use the following CloudFormation template to create
an IAM role named
1.  Resources:

AWS ECS monitoring

These are important points to consider with respect to AWS Container
Service (ECS) monitoring in preparation for the examination are listed as
follows:
• Monitoring ECS Cluster We can monitor CPU, memory, and storage
utilization for ECS cluster.

• Monitoring ECS task resource We can monitor CPU, memory, and
storage utilization of individual tasks which run on ECS cluster.

• Monitoring ECS task We can monitor the different states of tasks
running on ECS cluster such as whether a task is running, stopped, or
pending.

• Alarms on the metric threshold: We can set Alarms in AWS CloudWatch
to notify if a particular metric exceeds the threshold such as a task’s CPU
is greater than 85%.

• Logging task events: We can view log events for tasks running on the
ECS cluster such as task start, and task stopped events and any errors
which occur during task execution.

• Logging task container logs: We can check the container logs to
troubleshoot any issues such as OutOfMemory errors.

Conclusion

In this chapter, we explored various advanced features of AWS, including
the integration of AWS X-Ray with Lambda for application analysis, AWS
Kinesis Data Stream with Lambda for event processing, and the use of
CloudWatch Logs Insights for log data analysis. We also discussed
CloudWatch log retention policies, the importance of encrypting log data
using AWS KMS, and the use of AWS Inspector for security assessments
on EC2 instances. Lastly, we examined the configuration and automation
of AWS Config rules for maintaining resource compliance.

The knowledge gained in this chapter is crucial for the next chapter,
Troubleshooting and Restoring where we will apply our understanding of
AWS services to practical scenarios. We will tackle challenges like
troubleshooting failed deployments, automating responses to AWS Health
events, and analyzing root causes using AWS X-Ray. This chapter will
also explore effective management of message queues and S3 Event
Notifications, equipping us with essential skills for maintaining smooth
operations and quickly addressing issues in AWS environments.

### Page 790


Questions

1. How does an AWS X-Ray trace ID help in tracking a single request
through an application?

2. What is the default retention period of CloudWatch logs?

3. What components are included in an AWS Inspector assessment
template and how do they influence an assessment run?


---

### Page 791


Answers

1. An AWS X-Ray trace ID is used to track the journey of a single request
through an application. It collects data from every segment or part the
request interacts with, including load balancers, application code, and
calls to AWS services or external APIs. This helps in monitoring the
request’s path and performance, including latency and response times, as
it moves through the different components of the application.

2. By default, CloudWatch Logs are retained indefinitely and never expire.
The retention policy of a log group can be adjusted using the AWS
CloudWatch console or the AWS CLI. For instance, the command below
sets the retention policy of a log group named ‘my-log-group’ to 7 days:
1.  aws logs put-retention-policy \

2.   --log-group-name my-log-group \

3.     --retention-in-days 7

The following are the key components of the AWS Inspector assessment
template:

• Rules packages: Sets of rules used by Amazon Inspector Classic to
evaluate the security and compliance of the assessment target.

• Amazon SNS topics: Specifies the Simple Notification Service topics to
which Amazon Inspector Classic will send notifications regarding the


---

### Page 792

states and findings of the assessment run.

• Tags (key-value pairs): Allows you to assign tags to the findings
generated by the assessment run, facilitating organization and
categorization.

• Duration of the assessment run: Defines how long the assessment will
take place, setting a specific timeframe for the evaluation process.

Troubleshooting failed deployments

In this section, we will learn how to troubleshoot a failed deployment in
CodeDeploy. We will use an AWS Systems Manager Automation Runbook
named AWSSupport-TroubleshootCodeDeploy to assist us in diagnosing why
an AWS CodeDeploy deployment failed on EC2 instance. This runbook will
provide us with directions on how to resolve the issue or how to further
troubleshoot it.

There are several factors that can cause a CodeDeploy deployment to fail,
such as:

• The CodeDeploy agent is not installed or running on the EC2 instance.

• An AppSpec file is missing or incorrectly formatted.

• No Service role exists for CodeDeploy.

• The Service role associated with CodeDeploy does not have the correct
permissions to perform the intended operations on other AWS Services.

• API calls were throttled, meaning that CodeDeploy made too many requests
to other AWS Services like Lambda.

For the demonstration purpose, we will leverage the section Deploy Website
to EC2 with CodeDeploy, learned in Chapter 2: Continuous Delivery with

### Page 798

CodeDeploy and CodePipeline. For this case, we will purposely introduce an
error in the start_web_server.sh script. We are going to attempt to start a
service that does not exist on the system. Instead of trying to start the httpd
service, we will attempt to start a service named nonexistentservice. The error
in the script would be:

When AWS CodeDeploy runs this script as part of the deployment process, it
will fail because there no service with this name.

1.  #!/bin/bash

2.   sudo service nonexistentservice start

Follow the steps below to troubleshoot this error:

Navigate to the AWS Systems Manager Console.

In the left navigation pane, choose Automation under the Change
Management section.

Aggregate operational tasks using OpsCenter

AWS Systems Manager offers a capability that allows operations engineers
and IT professionals to manage operational work items, also known as
OpsItems, from a single location. The purpose of OpsCenter is to reduce the
Mean Time to Resolution for troubleshooting and resolving operational issues
impacting AWS services. This capability enables us to view contextual
investigation data about each OpsItem, including related Opsitems and
resources. OpsCenter provides System Manager Automation documents, or
runbooks, to aid in quickly resolving issues.

When you setup OpsCenter and integrate it with other AWS Services such as
AWS Config, AWS CloudWatch Events, or AWS EventBridge, it can
automatically create OpsItems. OpsCenter can also be used to investigate and
remediate operational issues on on-premises managed nodes as well that are
configured in Systems Manager.

In this section, we will create a CloudWatch Event rule that generates an
OpsItem for an EC2 service that publishes events to CloudWatch. We will
configure SSM OpsItem as the target for EC2 State changes events, such as
when an EC2 instance state changes from Running to

of AWS OpsCenter. However, there are many other scenarios where SSM
OpsItem can be configured as the target for various types of events. These
include:
• Security issues alerts from AWS Security Hub.
• Scheduled maintenance alerts from the AWS Health Dashboard.
• Failures within the AWS EC2 Auto Scaling group when launching an
instance.
• Failures during the execution of AWS Systems Manager automation
documents.

Auto Healing in AWS OpsWorks

The Auto Healing feature in AWS OpsWorks allows stacks to
automatically replace the failed instances in the layer. You can modify the
Auto healing settings by updating layer settings as shown in Figure


Figure Layer Settings for Auto Healing in AWS OpsWorks

Each instance that AWS OpsWorks Stack manages has an agent that
regularly communicates with the AWS OpsWorks service. If, for some
reason, an agent is unable to communicate with the service for more than
five minutes, AWS OpsWorks stacks consider the instance unhealthy and
replaces it with a new instance. Once the instance is online, AWS
OpsWorks Stack triggers a lifecycle event on all the stack’s instances. For
more information on lifecycle events in OpsWorks, please refer to the
AWS OpsWorks Stack Lifecycle Events section in Chapter Automation
using OpsWorks and Elastic Beanstalk.

### Page 808


Automating responses to AWS Health events

AWS Health sends various notifications to AWS customers on behalf of other
AWS services. These notifications are also referred to as Health Events. Some
Health events, known as Account-specific events, are unique to individual
accounts. For example, an issue might arise with an EC2 instance that a
customer uses in a specific region. Conversely, public events concern broader
service issues. An example would be an issue with the AWS S3 service that
affects customers in the N. Virginia (us-eas-t1) region. The AWS Health
Dashboard displays the status of both public and account-specific health
events.

Each Health Event type code provides insight into different event categories.
For instance:

• The AWS_S3_OPEN_ACCESS_BUCKET_NOTIFICATION event type
code pertains security and is classified under the notification category.

• type code indicates an operational issue with the EC2 service and belongs to
the issue category.

• The type code indicates a need for an EC2 instance reboot and is labeled as
a Scheduled

In this section, we explore how to automate the action of restarting an EC2
instance when a scheduled event occurs. Consider a scenario where AWS
identifies an irreparable issue with the hardware of an EC2 instance and


---

### Page 809

decides to retire it. Before this retirement takes place, the customers receive
an email detailing the instance ID and the scheduled retirement date. To
prevent data loss from the retiring instance, it is advised to back it up by
stopping it. When such an event arises, AWS Health communicates the event
type code of EC2 retirement to the AWS Health Dashboard. Once this event
is detected, the EventBridge rule triggers the AWS Systems Manager
Automation document called The architecture of the use case is depicted in
Figure

Analyzing root cause using X-Ray

AWS X-Ray assists in analyzing and debugging production and
distributed applications. It traces users’ requests, identifies bottlenecks,
and determines where higher latencies occur, allowing for refactoring of
the application to improve performance. In Chapter Auditing, Logging and
Monitoring Containers and Application, we learned how to integrate
AWS-Xray with serverless applications. We activated the X-Ray tracing
on a Lambda function, generated test traffic for the serverless application,
and then visualized the Service Map in the X-Ray console to view the
traces.

In this section, we explore how X-Ray is set up in container-based
applications within ECS/EKS environments. The architecture diagram
presented in Figure the X-Ray setup with ECS/EKS:



---

### Page 815


Figure 11.10: Architecture diagram of AWS X-Ray setup with ECS/EKS

Within ECS, X-Ray can be set up as a sidecar container in a Fargate task.
Sidecar containers are those that run alongside another container in the
same Fargate task. In contrast, within EKS, X-Ray can be established by
deploying an X-Ray pod as a Kubernetes Daemonset. A Daemonset is a
unique deployment strategy that places one instance of a pod onto each
node in the cluster. More information about Daemonset can be found at
the following link:

Fanout to AWS SQS Queues

In the Fanout scenario, when a message is published to an AWS Simple
Notification Service topic, it is pushed to multiple endpoints or subscribers,
such as Kinesis Data firehose delivery streams, AWS SQS queues, HTTP
endpoints, and Lambda functions. This eliminates the need for subscribers to
periodically poll for messages from the SNS topic. It allows for parallel
asynchronous processing. For example, when a customer places an order on
an e-commerce website, various microservices need to process the order, one
to handle inventory management, another to manage shipping, and a third to
send a confirmation email to the user. To ensure high availability and to
decouple these services, the e-commerce platform uses Amazon SNS to fan
out the order message to multiple Amazon SQS queues, each leading to a
different processing system. The architecture of this e-commerce website
application is shown in Figure

### Page 818

To implement this use case in your AWS account, follow the instructions
below:

1.  sam deploy --template-file template.yml \

2.   --stack-name ecommerce-order-processing-stack \

3.   --resolve-s3 \



---

### Page 820

4.   --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

Once the stack is successfully deployed, head to the SNS console and select
the SNS topic you have created. There, you can verify that both SQS queues
are subscribed to this topic, as shown in Figure


Figure queue subscriptions to the SNS topic

Publishing messages to the Upon publishing a new message, AWS SNS
delivers it to all subscribed endpoints. In our fanout scenario, the SQS queues
act as these endpoints. To send an SNS message, use the following AWS CLI
command:
1.  aws sns publish \

2.   --topic-arn [SNS_TOPIC_ARN] \

3.   --subject "NewOrderNotification" \



---

### Page 821

4.   --message "A new order has been placed."

Verifying the After sending the message, navigate to the AWS SAM
deployment outputs and retrieve the Queue URLs for both Simple Queue
Queues. Then, run the following AWS CLI command to verify the message
receipt:
1.  aws sqs receive-message \

2.   –queue-url QUEUE_URL

In conclusion, this use case demonstrates the integration of SNS and SQS
services in implementing Fanout pattern. By distributing messages to multiple
endpoints simultaneously, we can achieve efficient, decoupled, and parallel
processing in distributed and serverless applications.

Implementing Dead-Letter Queues in SQS

A dead-letter queue is a special type of message queue that temporarily
stores erroneous and failed messages that have no destination or cannot be
processed by the intended receiver. Moving failed messages to a DLQ aids
in troubleshooting, allowing developers or IT teams to identify the root
cause of the inability of the receiver to process the message. They can
address the issue in the system and attempt to redeliver the messages. As an
illustration, in our previously described e-commerce use-case, we can
integrate two DLQs, InventoryDLQ and These would be linked to the
InventoryManagementQueue and ShippingManagementQueue respectively,
enhancing the reliability and robustness of the system, as depicted in Figure

notifications when specific events occur within an S3 bucket. To enable
notifications, we must add notification configuration to S3 objects.
Additionally, we need to specify the destination where we want S3 to
publish these notifications.

S3 can publish notifications for the following events:

• New object creation, object removal, and replication object events

• S3 Lifecycle expiration and transition events

• Object tagging and ACL PUT events

• S3 Intelligent-tiering automatic archival events

The available destinations for S3 to send notification messages include:

• AWS SNS Topic

• AWS SQS Queue

• AWS Lambda Function

• AWS EventBridge

For example, the following snippet of the SAM template shows an S3
bucket notification configuration that sends an event to the specified SNS
topic when an object from the S3 bucket is permanently deleted:

1.  AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'

2.  Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31

3.  Description: Send notification from S3 to SNS when an object is
permantenly deleted

Troubleshooting CloudFormation stacks

Issues can arise when creating, updating, or deleting CloudFormation
stacks. This section provides guidance on troubleshooting common issues
and how to resolve them.

Below is a list of some common errors you might encounter with your
CloudFormation stacks, along with solutions for each problem:

• Circular This error occurs in CloudFormation when resources are
deployed in a way that creates a dependency loop, where two resources
depend on each other, or when a resource depends on itself. For instance,
consider the following template:

circulardependency-nonworking.yml
1.  Resources:

2.   MyEC2Instance:

3.     Type: AWS::EC2::Instance

4.     Properties:

5.       ImageId: !Ref MyImageId

6.       InstanceType: t2.micro


---

### Page 831


7.       SubnetId: !Ref 'MySubnetID'

8.       SecurityGroupIds:

9.         - !Ref 'MyInstanceSG'

10.       KeyName: !Ref 'MyKeyPairName'

11.   MyInstanceSG:

12.     Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup

13.     Properties:

14.       GroupDescription: My Security Group

15.       VpcId:

16.         Ref: MyVPCID

17.       SecurityGroupIngress:

18.         - IpProtocol: tcp

19.           FromPort: 80


---

### Page 832


20.           ToPort: 80

21.           SourceSecurityGroupId: !Ref MyInstanceSG

In this example, a circular dependency arises because the MyInstanceSG
security group is defined within the same resource as the ingress rule. This
causes a resource to depend on itself. To resolve this, you should separate
the security group definition from the ingress rule, ensuring that resources
do not have direct circular dependencies.

Here is a corrected version of the template:

circulardependency-working.yml
1.  Resources:

2.   MyEC2Instance:

3.     Type: AWS::EC2::Instance

4.     Properties:

5.       ImageId: !Ref MyImageId

6.       InstanceType: t2.micro

7.       SubnetId: !Ref 'MySubnetID'



---

### Page 833

8.       SecurityGroupIds:

9.         - !Ref 'MyInstanceSG'

10.       KeyName: !Ref 'MyKeyPairName'

11.   MyInstanceSG:

12.     Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup

13.     Properties:

14.       GroupDescription: My Security Group

15.       VpcId:

16.         Ref: MyVPCID

17.   MyInstanceSecurityGroupIngress:

18.     Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress

19.     Properties:

20.       Description: Security Group Ingress Rule

21.       GroupId: !Ref MyInstanceSG

24.       ToPort: 80

25.       SourceSecurityGroupId: !Ref MyInstanceSG

For the complete templates of both the working and nonworking versions,
you can refer to the BPB GitHub repository for this chapter.

• Deleting stack failed: Deleting a CloudFormation stack can fail if certain
resources must be emptied or removed before deletion, such as an S3
bucket or an EC2 security group. For instance, when dealing with an S3
bucket, it is necessary to delete all objects within it before the bucket itself
can be deleted. Similarly, when removing a security group resource, any
associated EC2 instances must be removed first.

• Rate exceeded errors: These errors occur when AWS service API calls
surpass the account’s allowable limit, leading to temporary API throttling.
Such issues can often be resolved by retrying after API activity decreases.
To mitigate these errors, consider creating/updating stacks sequentially,
requesting quota increases through support cases, or utilizing the
DependsOn attribute to control resource creation/update order and prevent
simultaneous spikes in API calls.



---

### Page 835

• Updating rollback failed: In the case of an AWS CloudFormation update
rollback failure state), an interdependent resource cannot revert to its
original state. For instance, if a stack is rolling back to a previous database
instance that was deleted externally, CloudFormation assumes the instance
still exists and tries to roll back to it, leading to the failure. To address this,
you may need to manually rectify the error and proceed with the rollback,
achieving a functional state Subsequently, you can attempt to update the
stack again.

Introduction

In the previous chapter, Troubleshooting and Restoring we delved into
both proactive and reactive strategies for incident response on AWS. We
discussed troubleshooting failed deployments, orchestrated operational
tasks using AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter, and leveraged AWS
OpsWorks auto-healing capabilities. We emphasized the significance of
automating responses to AWS Health events and highlighted the
techniques of using X-Ray for root cause analysis. Furthermore, we also
deepened our understanding of AWS SQS, especially with fanout
mechanisms and dead-letter queues.

As we transition to this chapter, our attention turns towards the event-
driven approach in AWS automation and security. We begin with an
exploration of event-driven automation through Kinesis. We acquaint
ourselves with AWS Inspector, laying the groundwork to grasp its features
and dive into automated security scans. As we progress, we explore AWS
GuardDuty’s threat detection automation. Finally, we integrate with the
third-party monitoring tool, DataDog, to visually present GuardDuty
findings.

### Page 844


Objectives

In this chapter, we dive into AWS’s event-driven automation using Kinesis
Firehose, teaching you to integrate CloudWatch logs with DataDog for
enhanced monitoring. We then shift to security with AWS Inspector,
guiding you through automated vulnerability scans in your AWS account
and immediate alerts via AWS SNS. To conclude, we delved into AWS
GuardDuty, setting up a pipeline to log, archive, and visualize findings
using DataDog, EventBridge, and S3. By the end of the chapter, you will
grasp AWS’s automation, security scanning, and threat detection
processes.

Event-driven automation with Kinesis

AWS Kinesis Firehose is a component of the Kinesis Streaming data platform
offered by AWS. This platform also includes other streaming services such as
Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Video Streams. AWS Kinesis Firehose is a
fully managed service that streams real-time data to various destinations,
including AWS S3, AWS Redshift, Splunk, and HTTP endpoints managed by
third parties like DataDog, Dynatrace and New Relic. By using Kinesis
Firehose, customers can avoid building custom applications or managing data
delivery infrastructure. The service automatically handles tasks such as error
management, autoscaling, data transformation, aggregation, and compression,
ensuring rapid data delivery.

In this section, we will demonstrate how to subscribe a CloudWatch log group
to a Kinesis Firehose stream for ingestion into DataDog. DataDog is an
Application Monitoring solution offering comprehensive visibility into both
on-premises and cloud environments. It assists customers in quicky
searching, filtering, and analyzing logs for troubleshooting purposes. We use
AWS SAM to create a CloudWatch log group, Kinesis Firehose stream, an
IAM role to enable CloudWatch logs to put data into Kinesis stream.

The architecture of this use-case is illustrated in Figure

DataDog Stack

4. Testing and It is time to test the setup by putting log events into the log
group and log stream we created in the previous step. Once the logs are
placed, we will verify their presence in both DataDog and the designated S3
bucket.

Start by preparing a sample log file named test_logs.log with the following
log entries:
1.  [

2.     {

3.         "timestamp": 1694886741316,

4.         "message": "TEST-MESSAGE-1"

5.     },

6.     {

7.         "timestamp": 1694886745851,

8.         "message": "TEST-MESSAGE-2"

9.     },

10.     {


---

### Page 854


11.         "timestamp": 1694886749841,

12.          "message": "TEST-MESSAGE-3"

13.     }

14.  ]

Before using the log file, ensure you update the timestamp in
example_logs.log to your current time. Execute the following command to
insert log events into a log stream named cloudwatch-log-stream in the log
group cloud watch-log-group:
1.  aws logs put-log-events \

2.  --log-group-name cloudwatch-log-group \

3.  --log-stream-name cloudwatch-log-stream \

4.  --log-events file://test_logs.log

After executing the command, wait for a few moments and then navigate to
the DataDog console. There, you should be able to view the streamed log
events, as depicted in Figure



---

### Page 855


Figure 12.3: Streamed Log Events Display in the DataDog Console

Next, retrieve the name of the S3 delivery bucket, which you should have
noted down from the stack output in the previous step. Within this S3 bucket,
you will find the logs delivered by Amazon Kinesis Firehose. Locate and
download the file corresponding to the specific date and time of your test.
Now run the following command to view the raw records:
1.  zcat [filename]

In summary, this section has guided you through the process of using AWS
Kinesis Firehose for real-time data streaming from CloudWatch logs to
DataDog. Utilizing AWS SAM, we set up necessary AWS resources,
eliminating the need for custom solutions and manual management. The
hands-on example demonstrates the power and scalability of Kinesis Firehose
for efficient data transfer and monitoring. This knowledge equips you to
adapt and implement similar real-time data streaming solutions in your own
projects.

AWS Inspector overview

Amazon Inspector provides automated security assessments for your EC2
instances and their applications. It identifies vulnerabilities and deviations
from best practices, delivering a prioritized list of security findings. The
service integrates seamlessly into development and deployment pipelines,
allowing for continuous security monitoring. An optional agent can also
be installed on EC2 instances to collect additional data, including network
and file system activity.

Amazon Inspector Classic offers three key benefits:

• Seamless It easily integrates into your deployment and production
workflows, allowing for continuous security assessments in both
development and production environments.

• Proactive vulnerability It automates the identification of application
security issues, aiding in quick development and ensuring compliance
with best practices.

• Enhanced resource It provides detailed findings on the activity and
configuration of your AWS resources, giving you a deeper understanding
of your cloud environment.

### Page 857


Automated security scan using AWS Inspector

In this section, we will learn how to automatically scan vulnerabilities in an
AWS account. We will create a schedule for host-based scanning of EC2
instances that are grouped by tags. Using the AWS CloudFormation Service,
we deploy all the resources and services required for this hands-on use-case.
The observations from AWS Inspector are exported to AWS Security Hub,
which provides a comprehensive view of the security state in the AWS
account and helps to align with industry standards and best practices. We also
receive email notifications about these findings through AWS Simple
Notification Service topic.

Figure 12.4 illustrates the workflow for automatically scanning EC2
instances:



---

### Page 858


Figure 12.4: Architecture diagram of Automated Security Scan by AWS
Inspector

The workflow includes an AWS EventBridge rule that uses a cron expression
to initiate the AWS Inspector scan on a specified schedule. The AWS
inspector scans the EC2 instances that have been tagged. The findings are
sent to AWS Security Hub, which provides insights into the security findings
along with prioritization and remediation recommendations. AWS Inspector
also sends the scan’s assessment status to an AWS SNS topic, and
notifications are subsequently emailed to subscribed email addresses when
the ASSESSMENT_RUN_COMPLETED event for the Inspector scan
occurs.

AWS GuardDuty overview

AWS GuardDuty is a threat detection service which continuously
monitors and protects customers’ AWS accounts, their workloads, and data
stored in AWS S3. It is easy to activate GuardDuty in AWS account
without additional software to deploy or manage. GuardDuty uses
machine learning anomaly detection, malware scanning and integrated
threat intelligence to identify and prioritize potential threats.

It analyzes and processes data from VPC flow logs, AWS CloudTrail
event logs, and DNS logs. There is no separate configuration or
management required to consume the data from these sources. Once
GuardDuty is activated in an AWS account, data is automatically
leveraged and analyzed.

Users can review GuardDuty findings in the AWS console. Additionally,
they can integrate these findings with event management or workflow
systems, or trigger AWS Lambda for automated remediation or
prevention.


---

### Page 875


Visualize AWS GuardDuty findings

In this section, we will utilize various AWS services to establish a pipeline for
AWS GuardDuty findings. This will allow us to log these findings in S3
buckets and visualize them in the DataDog monitoring system. When
GuardDuty detects a threat, it forwards the findings to an AWS EvnenBridge
rule. GuardDuty relays the newly generated findings to Eventbridge within 5
minutes of their discovery. We will set up an event pattern that only forwards
events originating from the GuardDuty service. Two targets are defined in the
EventBridge rule:

• A Kinesis Firehose stream, which delivers findings to both DataDog (for
visualization and analysis) and an S3 bucket (for long-term archiving).

• An SNS topic ensuring we receive email notifications regarding these
findings

DataDog provides visualization and in-depth analysis of event findings.
Additionally, the Kinesis Firehose stream stores the findings in an S3 bucket
for long-term retention. Data stored in the S3 bucket can be further analyzed
using AWS Athena for advanced analytics, although this Athena-based
analysis falls outside the scope of our current use case.

The architecture diagram of the pipeline we have constructed build is
illustrated in Figure

### Page 877


Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the setup, it is important to ensure the following
prerequisites are met, as they are essential for the successful implementation
and operation of the system:

• AWS GuardDuty must be enabled. Once enabled, GuardDuty will
immediately start monitoring for security threats in your AWS account.

• An account with DataDog. Ensure you note down the API key.

1. Creating a CloudFormation Begi by creating a CloudFormation template
named This template will set up the necessary pipeline and components for
visualizing GuardDuty findings in Key parts of the template are as follows:

•  Parameters This section defines four parameters for the setup.
EmailAddress is used to specify an email address for subscribing to SNS
notifications. DeliveryBucketName determines the name of the S3 bucket
where raw findings will be stored. MyDataDogEndPointUrlName represents

findings to DataDog and an S3 bucket. It contains configurations for: An
HTTP Endpoint setup specifically for DataDog using the provided API key
and endpoint URL. An S3 Configuration detailing how the findings will be
delivered to the S3 bucket, which includes buffering hints and role
permissions. It also defines which S3 bucket the findings will be delivered to.
A backup setting ensures all data is also sent to the S3 bucket for redundancy.

For a comprehensive view of this CloudFormation template, please refer to
the GitHub repository linked with Chapter 12 of this book.

2. Validate the CloudFormation template: Validate the CloudFormation
template by running the following command using the AWS CLI:

1.  aws cloudformation validate-template \

2.   --template-body file://template.yml

3. Deploying the CloudFormation template: Deploy the CloudFormation
template using the following command in the AWS CLI:



---

### Page 881

1.  aws cloudformation deploy \

2.   --template-file template.yml \

3.   --stack-name guardduty-eventbridge-firehose-datadog-stack \

4.   --parameter-overrides \

5.   DeliveryBucketName=[your_devliery_bucket_name] \

6.   EmailAddress=[your_email_address] \

7.   MyDataDogApiKey=[your_datadog_api_key] \

8.   --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

After the CloudFormation stack has been successfully created proceed to the
next step. Do not forget to confirm the subscription in the email which you
received from AWS SNS Service.

4. Testing and validation: To ensure that our pipeline for visualizing
GuardDuty findings in DataDog is working as expected, we will intentionally
trigger a finding by modifying the access settings of an S3 bucket and
validate that these findings are logged and visualized correctly. Follow the
steps below to evaluate the pipeline:

i.  Choosing an S3 Bucket for testing: Navigate to the Amazon S3 console in
your AWS account. Choose any existing bucket where the Block all public
access setting is turned This will ensure that we do not expose any sensitive
data during our test.


---

### Page 882


ii.  Modifying bucket permissions: In the S3 dashboard, click on the name of
the chosen bucket. Navigate to the Permissions tab. Under Block all public
access, click Edit. Toggle Block all public access to OFF as shown in Figure
Save changes by clicking the Save changes button. You might be asked for
confirmation; type confirm and proceed.


Figure 12.10: Disabling “Block all public access” in the S3 bucket
permissions

iii.  Waiting and monitoring: After making this change, AWS GuardDuty
should recognize this as a potential security threat. Please wait for
approximately 5 minutes for GuardDuty to detect and generate the finding.

iv.  Validating notification in DataDog: Log in to your DataDog account. You
should see a new log entry corresponding to the GuardDuty finding, as
illustrated in Figure



---

### Page 883


Figure 12.11: GuardDuty Finding Visualization in DataDog

Additionally, verify the email address that you provided while setting up the
pipeline. You should have received a notification from the AWS SNS Service
detailing the GuardDuty finding, as depicted in Figure


Figure 12.12: Email notification of GuardDuty Finding via AWS SNS service


---

### Page 884


v.  Revert bucket permissions: It is essential to ensure that the Block all
public access setting is turned back ON after the testing to maintain the
security of your AWS resources. Go back to the chosen S3 bucket in the AWS
console. Navigate to the Permissions tab. Under Block all public access, click
Toggle Block all public access to ON and save changes. By following the
above steps, you will have successfully validated that the GuardDuty findings
pipeline to DataDog and email notifications are functioning correctly.

In conclusion, AWS GuardDuty, a threat detection service for AWS, was
activated to monitor AWS account activities and S3 data. Utilizing AWS
CloudFormation, we established a pipeline where GuardDuty findings are
processed through AWS EventBridge, streamed to an S3 bucket, and
notifications dispatched via Amazon SNS. These findings are also visualized
in DataDog. For validation, we adjusted S3 bucket permissions, with a strict
emphasis on promptly reverting changes post-testing to maintain resource
security.

Conclusion

In this chapter, we delved into AWS’s event-driven automation with
Kinesis, explored AWS Inspector, and deepened our understanding of
GuardDuty’s threat detection. As we move to the next chapter, we will
shift our focus to AWS’s security and management tools. We will learn
about sensitive data identification with AWS Macie, enhance security with
AWS WAF for CloudFront, streamline operations using AWS Systems
Manager, and manage secrets efficiently with AWS Secret Manager. The
upcoming lessons will further solidify your grasp on AWS’s diverse
capabilities.

Points to remember

• AWS Kinesis Firehose, a component of the Kinesis Streaming data
platform, efficiently streams real-time data to multiple destinations, such
as AWS S3, AWS Redshift, and HTTP endpoints of third-party services
like DataDog, facilitating easy monitoring and analysis.

• Amazon Inspector provides automated security assessments for EC2
instances and applications, identifying vulnerabilities and best practice
deviations, and integrates well into development and deployment pipelines
for continuous security monitoring.

• Setting up automated security scans using AWS Inspector involves
scheduling host-based scans of EC2 instances grouped by tags, with
findings exported to AWS Security Hub for a comprehensive security
overview and notifications through AWS SNS.

• AWS GuardDuty, a threat detection service, continuously monitors and
protects AWS accounts, workloads, and AWS S3 data using machine
learning, malware scanning, and integrated threat intelligence, analyzing
data from sources like VPC flow logs and AWS CloudTrail.

• Visualization of AWS GuardDuty findings can be achieved by creating a
pipeline using AWS services, where findings are logged in S3 buckets and
visualized in DataDog, with an EventBridge rule forwarding GuardDuty

Sensitive data discovery job using AWS Macie

AWS Macie is a security service that helps discover, classify, and protect
sensitive data stored in S3 buckets. It uses machine learning and pattern
matching capabilities and provides insights with Dashboards and alerts to
show how sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, social security
numbers, and Personal Identifiable Information is accessed or moved. Macie
discovers sensitive data in S3 buckets using automated sensitive data
discovery and Sensitive data discovery jobs.

With the first option, Macie monitors S3 buckets daily and supplies broad
visibility to sensitive data that resides in the S3 bucket. With the second
option, Macie provides a deeper analysis of S3 buckets by providing custom
criteria defined by the user.

In this example, we will enable AWS Macie and Security Hub on the AWS
account. We will utilize the fully managed sensitive data type available in
Macie and create a job to discover this sensitive data in the S3 bucket. An
AWS EventBridge rule is set up to automatically identify and respond to
security incidents reported by Macie, triggering an SNS topic notification.
Subsequently, Macie also reports these findings to AWS Security Hub.

The architecture of this use case is shown in Figure

After creating the create-resources.sh script, it’s time to run it to set up AWS
Macie and AWS Security Hub for the demo. This script will enable these
services in your specified AWS region and configure them to send alerts to
your email address. It will also create the necessary resources using AWS
CloudFormation.

To execute the script, use the following command in your terminal. Replace
us-east-1 with your desired AWS region, and [your-email-address] with your
actual email address where you want to receive alerts:
1.  ./create-resources.sh us-east-1 [your-email-address]

While the CloudFormation stack creation is in progress, we will receive an
email from AWS SNS asking us to confirm the subscription, as shown in
Figure Click the Confirm subscription link to confirm the subscription.

3. Uploading sample In this step, we will create a sample CSV file containing
fake sensitive data. First, create a subdirectory named data inside the Macie-
demo directory. Next, create a CSV file named sample-data-macie.csv and
add an entry containing data from Figure

information (PII) information

Create another shell script named upload-data.sh in the scripts subdirectory
and copy the following contents. The script retrieves the name of the S3
bucket from a CloudFormation stack output and uses it to copy a CSV file to
that S3 bucket:

4. Creating classification job: In this step, we will create a one-time sensitive
data discovery job named Macie Demo Scan bucket using AWS CLI.

Create a subdirectory named job-specs in the Macie-demo directory. Then,
create a JSON template named Macie-job-spec.json inside the macie-demo
subdirectory and copy the following contents:
1.  {

This JSON template consists of four managed data identifiers
DATA_OF_BIRTH and as well as the type of job AWS account ID, S3 bucket
name, and the file extension The file extension limits AWS Macie to inspect
only .CSV files.
Now, the folder structure in the macie-demo directory will look like this:

1.  aws macie2 create-classification-job \

2.   --name "Macie Demo Scan Bucket" \

3.   --cli-input-json file://job-specs/macie-job-spec.json

5. Analyzing scan results: It will take several minutes for Macie to complete
the job. Once the job is finished go to the Macie console and click on the Jobs
menu item on the left. Select the job named Macie Demo Scan click on Show
and then click on Show findings to open the Findings page. From here, select
a finding to show its details such as the Bucket name, encryption type and the
name of the S3 object as shown in Figure

Protect AWS CloudFront distribution with AWS WAF

AWS Web Application Firewall service helps us protect web applications
from common attacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other
attacks. WAF allows us to create custom rules to decide whether we want to
block or allow HTTP/HTTPS requests before they reach web applications.
One of the use cases for WAF is to block requests from a specific country or
geolocation.

In this example, we will create a WAF Access Control List and add a
geographic match rule to block traffic from the US. We will attach this ACL
to the CloudFront distribution created in Chapter Infrastructure as Code using
under the section Continuous delivery pipeline for AWS CloudFormation
Nested

The architecture diagram in Figure 13.8 has been revised to include AWS
WAF service, highlighted by arrow #6:



---

### Page 915


Figure 13.8: Updated architecture diagram - Continuous delivery pipeline to
deploy CloudFormation Nested Stacks

Follow the step-by-step procedure below to complete this use case on your
AWS account.

1. Creating a CloudFormation template: Create a YAML template named
template.yml and copy the following contents:
1.  Resources:

2.   MyWebACL:

3.     Type: AWS::WAFv2::WebACL

4.     Properties:


---

### Page 916


5.       Name: Block-US-Web-Requests

6.       Scope: CLOUDFRONT

7.       DefaultAction:

8.         Allow: {}

9.       Description: Block all web requests from the US

10.       VisibilityConfig:

11.         SampledRequestsEnabled: true

12.         CloudWatchMetricsEnabled: true

13.         MetricName: Block-US-WebRequests-Metric

14.       Rules:

15.         - Name: Block-US-Requests

16.           Priority: 0

17.           Action:

18.             Block: {}



---

### Page 917

19.           VisibilityConfig:

21.             CloudWatchMetricsEnabled: true

22.             MetricName: BlockUsWebRequestsMetric

23.           Statement:

24.             GeoMatchStatement:

25.               CountryCodes:

## 26.                 - US

The CloudFormation template above creates a WAF2 WebACL with a geo-
match rule that blocks all web requests originating from a specified country
for a specified CloudFront distribution.

2. Creating CloudFormation stack: Run the following command using AWS
CLI to create a CloudFormation Stack named

1.  aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name \

2.   waf2-cloudformation-stack --template-body file://template.yml



---

### Page 918

The CloudFormation stack creates an AWS WAFv2 ACL resource that
includes a single rule to block traffic from the US. The rule’s statement block
holds a GeoMatchStatement that checks the country code of the IP address
associated with the web request and blocks the request if the country code is
The rule’s scope is a specific AWS CloudFront distribution, which allows you
to apply the WAF rules to a specific set of web resources. This ACL resource
helps protect web applications from malicious traffic originating from the US.

When the status of stack creation becomes we can view the resources created
by the CloudFormation stack, as shown in Figure


Figure 13.9: Resources created by CloudFormation stack for AWS WAF and
CloudFront Demo

Go to AWS WAF Console and click on Web ACLs on the left. Then, click on
the Web ACL named Block-US-Web-Requests and select the Rules tab. Click
on the rule named Block-US-Requests as shown in Figure By examining the
rule, it is evident that requests originating from the US are blocked, while
requests from other geographic locations are not blocked.



---

### Page 919


Figure 13.10: WAF rule which blocks the web requests originated from US

3. Associate WAF Web ACL with CloudFront distribution: Go to the
CloudFront console and select the CloudFront distribution, click on Edit
Settings panel. Choose the AWS WAF web ACL – optional dropdown and
select the WAF ACL created in Step Click on Save Changes as shown in
Figure It may take a few minutes for the CloudFront service to associate the
WAF ACL with the distribution.

4. Testing the WAF Copy the CloudFront Distribution domain name and paste
it into a browser. If we attempt to access the website from a US location, we
will observe a 403 ERROR message, as shown in Figure This error message
indicates that the web request has been blocked by the WAF rule associated
with the CloudFront distribution.

Store configuration in AWS SSM Parameter Store

AWS SSM Parameter Store supplies a centralized way to store and manage
the application’s configuration data and secrets in a secure and scalable
manner. Parameters can be stored as plaintext or KMS-encrypted strings and
can be created and managed using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI,
or SDKs.

In this example, we will store configuration data in the Parameter Store and
retrieve the same parameter using the AWS CLI. To complete this example on
your AWS account, follow the step-by-step procedure below:

1. Store Create a shell script named put-paramater.sh and copy the following
contents:
1.  #!/bin/bash

2.

3.  # Create kms key

4.  kms_key_id=$(aws kms create-key --description "kms key for systems
manager param store" \

5.   --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT --query KeyMetadata.KeyId --output
text)

6.


---

### Page 923


7.  echo "kms key id is : $kms_key_id"

8.

9.  aws ssm put-parameter \

10.     --name "my-test-parameter" \

11.     --value "my-test-parameter-value" \

12.     --type "SecureString" \

13.     --key-id $kms_key_id \

14.     --overwrite

Run the above script in your terminal in the us-east-1 region. This script
creates a symmetric customer-managed encryption key in your AWS Key
Management Service This key is used to encrypt the parameter value in the
Parameter Store. From Figure we can see the name of the parameter, its
SecureString data type, and the value of the parameter:



---

### Page 924


Figure 13.13: Storing Configuration in Parameter Store

2. Retrieve In this section, we will retrieve the parameter that was added in
the earlier step using the AWS CLI. This command queries the parameter
named my-test-parameter and returns the decrypted value of the parameter:
1.  aws ssm get-parameter \

2.     --name "my-test-parameter" \

3.     --with-decryption

After running the get-parameter command, the output displays the retrieved
parameter details in JSON format. The Value parameter in the output displays
the actual value of the retrieved parameter, which is This value corresponds to
the value that was set in Step Therefore, we have successfully retrieved the
parameter value from the AWS SSM Parameter Store using the AWS CLI:
1.  {

2.     "Parameter": {

Automating administrative task using AWS SSM

AWS Systems Manager is a management AWS service that enables us to get
operational insights and take actions at scale. In this example, we will learn
how to use the AWS SSM. Run a command from the AWS CLI to execute a
shell script using the AWS CLI. The run command feature eliminates the need
for a bastion host or SSH connection to the instance. The architecture of this
use case is shown in Figure


Figure 13.14: Executing a Remote Shell Script on an EC2 Instance Using
SSM Run Command

To implement this example in your AWS account, follow the detailed step-by-
step procedure outlined below:

1. Creating an IAM role: In this step, we will create an IAM role that grants
permissions to the System Manager to perform actions on the EC2 instance


---

### Page 927

that we will create in the next step.

To create the IAM role, we will first create a JSON template named trust-
policy.json and copy the following contents into it:
1.  {

2.     "Version": "2012-10-17",

3.     "Statement": [

4.         {

5.             "Effect": "Allow",

6.             "Principal": {

7.                 "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"

8.             },

9.             "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"

10.         }

11.     ]

12.  }



---

### Page 928

The above JSON template specifies the trust policy for the IAM role that we
will create in the shell script. It allows the EC2 service to assume the role,
which grants permission to the EC2 instance to communicate with the SSM
service.

Here is the shell script that creates the IAM role:
1.  #!/bin/sh

2.

3.  # Creates a role and attaches a trust policy

4.  aws iam create-role \

5.     --role-name my-ssm-role \

6.     --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json

7.

8.  # Attaches AWS managed policy

9.  aws iam attach-role-policy \

10.     --role-name my-ssm-role \

11.     --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-
role/AmazonEC2RoleforSSM


---

### Page 929


12.

13.  # Creates instance profile

14.  aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name \

15.   my-ec2-instance-profile

16.

17.  # Adds role to the instance profile

18.  aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name \

19.   my-ec2-instance-profile --role-name my-ssm-role

The script creates the IAM role required for an EC2 instance to communicate
with the SSM service. It first creates the IAM role, attaches the trust policy to
it, attaches an AWS-managed policy, and then creates an instance profile and
adds the role to the instance profile.

2. Creating an EC2 In this step, we will use AWS CLI to launch an EC2
instance and assign an instance profile that allows the EC2 instance to
communicate with the SSM service.

To create an EC2 instance, run the following command:

1.  aws ec2 run-instances \


---

### Page 930


2.     --image-id ami-006dcf34c09e50022 \

3.     --count 1 \

4.     --instance-type t2.micro \

5.     --iam-instance-profile Name=my-ec2-instance-profile

This command launches an instance of type using the AMI ID ami-
006dcf34c09e50022 in the default subnet associated with the default VPC.
The instance profile named my-ec2-instance-profile is assigned to provide
permission for the EC2 instance to communicate with the SSM service.

Once the instance is running, obtain the instance ID as shown in Figure This
instance ID will be used in the next step to run a remote shell script.

The SSM Agent is software that runs on an EC2 instance. The agent takes
command requests from the SSM service, processes them, and sends the
execution status of the command back to the SSM service.


Figure 13.15: The launched EC2 instance is ready for some action to be
performed by the SSM Run command



---

### Page 931

3. Running a remote shell This step involves running a remote shell script
using AWS CLI and Systems Manager Run Command. The output of the
command is sent to a CloudWatch log group named

The following command is used:
1.  aws ssm send-command \

2.     --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" \

3.     --parameters 'commands=["echo HelloWorld"]' \

4.     --targets "Key=instanceids,Values=i-085c552a282e537c5" \

5.     --comment "echo HelloWorld" \

6.     --cloud-watch-output-config
"CloudWatchOutputEnabled=true,CloudWatchLogGroupName=my-clw-
groupname" \

7.     --region us-east-1

This command uses the SSM document named AWS-RunShellScript to run
the command on the EC2 instance. The command to run is specified in the
command’s parameter, which is set to ["echo

4. Viewing the output in CloudWatch Go to the CloudWatch console, select
Logs on the left, select Log open the log group named and then select the log
stream. The logs in the log stream will display the HelloWorld message as
shown in Figure This value corresponds to the command that was echoed

Patching using SSM Patch Manager

SSM Patch Manager allows us to automate the process of patching managed
instances with security-related and other types of updates. We can apply
patches for both operating systems and applications. We can install patches
individually or for a group of EC2 instances, or for on-premises servers and
virtual machines by operating system type. Patch manager uses patch
baselines that include a rule for auto-approving patching within days of their
releases along with a list of approved and rejected patches. Using the SSM
maintenance window task, we can schedule the installation of the patches on
individual EC2 instances or fleet of EC2 instances using EC2 tags.

In this example, we will use SSM Patch Manager to patch an EC2 instance.
We will create a patch baseline to define which patches to install. The Patch
Manager will scan and install any missing patches on the EC2 instance using
the EC2 resource tag via patch group. Finally, we will schedule the patch
promotion process using a maintenance window. The architecture of this
example is shown in Figure



---

### Page 934


Figure 13.17: Patch EC2 Instance using SSM Patch Manager


---

### Page 935


Prerequisites

In this step, we will tag the EC2 instance previously created in the Automate
administrative task using AWS SSM example. This tagging is necessary for
the SSM Patch Manager to identify and manage the instance.

Execute the following AWS CLI command to add the env=prod tag to your
EC2 instance:

1.   aws ec2 create-tags \

2.     --resources [instance_id] \

3.     --tags Key=env,Value=prod

1. Developing automation script: To automate the patching process, create a
shell script named This script will consist of several key sections, each
responsible for different aspects of automation:

•  Creating a patch baseline: First, we’ll create a patch baseline. This baseline
will specify which patches should be applied to the instances. The following
lines of the script set up a baseline that auto-approves critical security patches
after 3 days of their release:

1.  #!/bin/bash

2.


---

### Page 936


3.  #Create a patch base pipeline

4.  baseline_id=$(aws ssm create-patch-baseline --name "Linux-Production-
Baseline-AutoApproval" \

5.     --operating-system "AMAZON_LINUX_2" \

6.     --approval-rules 'PatchRules=[{PatchFilterGroup={PatchFilters=
[{Key=SEVERITY,Values=[Critical]},{Key=CLASSIFICATION,Values=
[Security]}]},ApproveAfterDays=3}]' \

7.     --description "Baseline containing all updates approved for Security
patches" \

8.     --query 'BaselineId' --output text)

9.

10.  echo "Patch baseline id is: $baseline_id"

•  Registering the baseline to a patch group: Next, we register the created
patch baseline to a patch group. This group is used to manage which instances
receive the patches:

1.  # Register patch baseline to a patch group

2.  aws ssm register-patch-baseline-for-patch-group \


---

### Page 937


3.   --baseline-id $baseline_id \

4.   --patch-group "Patch Group for EC2 Instance"

•  Creating a Maintenance Window: Now, we’ll create a maintenance
window. This window defines when the patches will be applied. We set it to
run every Tuesday at 7 PM EST:

1.  # Create maintenance window

2.  window_id=$(aws ssm create-maintenance-window \

3.   --name "Maintenance-Window-PROD-EveryTues" \

4.   --tags "Key=env,Value=prod" \

5.   --schedule "cron(0 0 19 ? * TUE *)" \

6.   --schedule-timezone "America/New_York" \

7.   --duration 1 \

8.   --cutoff 0 \

9.   --no-allow-unassociated-targets --query 'WindowId' --output text)

10.


---

### Page 938


11.  echo "Window Id is: $window_id"

•  Registering patch group and task with maintenance Finally, we associate
the patch group with the maintenance window and set up a task to install the
missing security updates.

1.  # Register patch group with maintenance windows

2.  window_target_id=$(aws ssm register-target-with-maintenance-window \

3.   --window-id $window_id \

4.   --targets "Key=tag:env,Values=prod" \

5.   --owner-information "EC2 Instance" \

6.   --resource-type "INSTANCE" --query 'WindowTargetId' --output text)

7.

8.  echo "Window Target Id is: $window_target_id"

9.

10.  # Register patch task to install missing security update on EC2 instance

11.  window_task_id=$(aws ssm register-task-with-maintenance-window \

Automatic Rotation of Secret in AWS Secret Manager

AWS Security Manager service makes it easier to manage secrets such as
database credentials, passwords, Application Programming Interface keys,
SSH keys, private keys, certificates etc. The Secret manager replaces the
usage of these secrets in software code, which ensures they cannot be
compromised by looking into the code because they no longer exist in the
code. Additionally, it helps to rotate the secret according to the specified
schedule.

In this example, we will create a secret which stores an API Key. We will
write a Lambda function that rotates the API key. We will then configure the
automatic rotation of this secret using the Lambda function. The automatic
rotation happens every 30 days. All of these are achieved through AWS CLI
commands.

1. Creating a secret: Run the following command using AWS CLI, which
creates a secret named MyTestAPIKeySecret in AWS Secret Manager in the
us-east-1 region:
1.  aws secretsmanager create-secret \

2.     --name MyTestAPIKeySecret \

3.     --secret-string "949fbfc1-12e5-4730-aa29-911685b50aac" \

4.     --description "My API Key Secret"



---

### Page 942

The created secret can be viewed by going to the Secret Manager console, as
shown in Figure


Figure 13.19: Stored secret in AWS Secret Manager

Note down the ARN of this secret, which will be used in the next step:

1.  arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-
1:111111111111:secret:MyTestAPIKeySecret-dgtXON

2. Creating Lambda Function to rotate Go to the Lambda Console and click
on Create function. Enter the details as shown in Figure Once the details are
entered, click on the Create function at the bottom.



---

### Page 943


Figure 13.20: Create Secret Rotation Lambda Function

Go to the Code tab and replace the existing Python code in the
lambda_function.py file with the following code:
1.  import boto3

2.  import json

3.  import uuid

4.  from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

5.

6.  def generate_new_api_key():



---

### Page 944

7.     # Generate new API key

8.     return str(uuid.uuid4())

9.

10.  def lambda_handler(event, context):

11.     secret_name = "MyTestAPIKeySecret"

12.     region_name = "us-east-1"

13.

14.     session = boto3.session.Session()

15.     client = session.client(

16.         service_name='secretsmanager',

17.         region_name=region_name,

18.     )

19.

20.     get_secret_value_response = client.get_secret_value(

21.             SecretId=secret_name


---

### Page 945


22.     )

This Lambda function fetches the value of the created secret named
MyTestAPIKeySecret from AWS Secrets Manager using the get_secret_value
API. If the secret is a string value, the function then calls
generate_new_api_key() to generate a new API key and updates the value of
the secret using the update_secret API. The generate_new_api_key() function
generates a random UUID (universally unique identifier) as a string.

3. Adding an IAM Policy to the Lambda function: Go to the Configuration
tab of the Lambda function, click on the role listed in the Execution role
panel, and create an inline policy named Attach this policy to the Lambda
execution role. This policy allows the rotation Lambda function to run Secret
Manager operations for the Secret ARN noted down in Step which is for the
secret named

12.             ]

13.          },

14.         {

15.             "Effect": "Allow",

16.             "Action": "secretsmanager:UpdateSecret",

17.             "Resource": "*"

18.         }

19.     ]

20.  }

4. resource-based policy to Lambda function: Go to the Configuration tab of
the Lambda function, click on Add permissions under the Resource-based
policy statements panel, then select AWS Service from the Policy statement
options. Enter the necessary details as shown in Figure 13.21 and click on


Figure 13.21: Resource-based Policy Added to Lambda Function

This policy will grant permission to Secret Manager service to invoke the
rotation lambda function when the secret is rotated in the next step.


---

### Page 948


5. Rotating secret: In this step, we will configure and start automatic rotation
for the secret named MyTestAPIKeySecret that was created in Step We will
use the AWS CLI command rotate-secret to accomplish this. Before we rotate
the secret, let us check the current value of the secret string stored in
MyTestAPIKeySecret secret. Run the following command which retrieves the
secret value:

1.  aws secretsmanager get-secret-value \

2.     --secret-id MyTestAPIKeySecret \

3.     --query SecretString \

4.     --output text

The output of above the command displays 949fbfc1-12e5-4730-aa29-
911685b50aac which is the same value added to the secret in Step

Next that we’ve verified the current value of the MyTestAPIKeySecret secret,
the next step is to set up and start its automatic rotation. We accomplish this
using the rotate-secret command in the AWS CLI. This command configures
the secret to rotate automatically every 30 days. The first execution of this
command will immediately trigger a rotation of the secret. Subsequent
rotations will follow the defined schedule.
1.  aws secretsmanager rotate-secret \

2.     --secret-id MyTestAPIKeySecret \



---

### Page 949

3.     --rotation-lambda-arn arn:aws:lambda:us-east-
1:111111111111:function:secret-rotation-lambda \

4.     --rotation-rules AutomaticallyAfterDays=30

After the rotation is complete, run the following command again to check if
the value for the secret string has changed:
1.  aws secretsmanager get-secret-value \

2.     --secret-id MyTestAPIKeySecret \

3.     --query SecretString \

4.     --output text

If the rotation was successful, the output of the above command will display a
new value for the secret string, such as This confirms that our rotation
Lambda function is working as expected.

Creating an AWS organization and an account

AWS organizations are used in large corporations with multiple AWS
accounts. They enable the implementation and enforcement of security, audit,
and compliance policies, and facilitate the sharing of resources across AWS
accounts. The management account in the organization is responsible for
paying for the usage of AWS resources within the organization.

In this example, we will develop an automation script. The script will create
an AWS organization, an AWS account, and an Organization Unit We will
also create a Service Control Policy and apply it at the OU level.

1. Develop automation script: Start by creating an application directory
named Under this directory create a shell script named create-org.sh and
structure it as follows:
•  Creating the organization: This part of the script initializes the creation of a
new AWS organization:

1.  #!/bin/bash

2.

3.  # Create organization

4.  aws organizations create-organization \

5.   --query 'Organization.[Id]' \


---

### Page 953


6.   --output text

•  Creating a new account: The script then proceeds to create a new account
within the organization. It captures the request ID and continuously checks
the status of the account creation process:

1.  # Create account

2.  request_id=$(aws organizations create-account \

3.   --email " testuser-YOUR-UNIQUE-IDENTIFIER@gmail.com"  \

4.   --account-name "devops-account" \

5.   --query 'CreateAccountStatus.[Id]' \

6.   --output text)

7.  echo "Request Id is: $request_id"

8.

9.  while true; do

10.     result=$(aws organizations describe-create-account-status --create-
account-request-id $request_id)



---

### Page 954

11.     state=$(echo $result | jq -r '.CreateAccountStatus.State')

12.     if [[ $state == "SUCCEEDED" ]]; then

13.         echo "Account creation completed successfully"

14.         break

15.     elif [[ $state == "FAILED" ]]; then

16.         echo "Account creation failed"

17.         exit 1

18.     else

19.         echo "Waiting for account creation to complete..."

20.         sleep 10

21.     fi

22.  done

•  Retrieving account information: Once the account is created, the script
retrieves and displays the account ID:

1.  # Get Account Id


---

### Page 955


2.  account_id=$(aws organizations describe-create-account-status \

3.   --create-account-request-id $request_id \

4.   --query 'CreateAccountStatus.[AccountId]' \

5.   --output text)

6.  echo "Account Id: $account_id"

•  Setting up Organizational Units (OUs): The script then identifies the root
ID of the organization and creates an Organizational Unit (OU), moving the
newly created account into this OU:

1.  # Get root id of organization

2.  root_id=$(aws organizations list-roots --query 'Roots[0].[Id]' \

3.   --output text)

4.  echo "Root Id is: $root_id"

5.

6.  # Create OU

7.  ou_id=$(aws organizations create-organizational-unit \


---

### Page 956


8.   --parent-id $root_id \

9.   --name="OU" \

10.   --query 'OrganizationalUnit.[Id]' \

11.   --output text)

12.  echo "OU Id is: $ou_id"

13.

14.  # Move account to OU

15.  aws organizations move-account \

16.   --account-id $account_id \

17.   --source-parent-id $root_id \

18.   --destination-parent-id $ou_id

•  Completion and verification: The script takes a few seconds to complete.
Once done, navigate to the AWS Organizations console to verify the changes.
On the left, click on AWS On the right, you should see the root account,
management account, OUs, and AWS accounts, as illustrated in Figure

28.  # Apply SCP Policy to OU

29.  aws organizations attach-policy \

30.     --policy-id $policy_id \

31.     --target-id $ou_id

This script retrieves the organization Root Id, enables SCP for the
organization, creates an SCP that blocks CloudTrail configuration actions for
member AWS accounts, and applies this policy to the OU created in Step
Figure 13.24 shows that the SCP has been successfully applied to the member
AWS account successfully.

Security data with AWS CloudHSM

The AWS CloudHSM service extends the security benefits associated with
hardware security modules to the AWS Cloud. An HSM is a physical
computing device that safeguards and manages digital keys, ensuring strong
authentication and providing crypto processing. Traditionally, these modules
are either plug-in cards or external devices that connect directly to a computer
or network server.

With CloudHSM, you can manage and access your keys on FIPS 140-2 Level
3 certified hardware. This service is protected with customer-owned, single-
tenant HSM instances that operate within your virtual private cloud

The following are the key benefits offered by AWS CloudHSM to the
customers:
• FIPS 140-2 Level-3 Validated AWS CloudHSM uses standards-compliant,
single-tenant, and FIPS 140-2 Level-3 validated HSMs, offering more
flexibility compared to other managed AWS services with fixed algorithms
and key lengths.

• End-to-end encryption invisible to Your data plane is fully encrypted and
not visible to AWS, offering you full control over user management outside of
IAM roles.

• Complete Full control of your keys, algorithms, and application
development is in your hands. Generate, store, import, export, manage, and
use various cryptographic keys, all while having full authority over

AWS Directory Service overview

Active Directory on AWS offers varied options. One choice is deploying EC2
Windows Instances as domain controllers. A more streamlined solution is the
AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory (AWS Managed
Microsoft AD), a fully managed service ensuring the maintenance of AD
domain controllers, covering security, patching, and backups.

Using AWS Managed Microsoft AD, AWS sets up a pair of domain
controllers in a new AD forest within a dedicated single-tenant AWS
Managed VPC and Elastic Network Interfaces in two Availability Zones in
your VPC. This setup supports directory-aware workloads, custom .NET, and
SQL Server-based applications in the AWS Cloud, and allows a trust
relationship between AWS Managed Microsoft AD and an on-premises
Microsoft Active Directory, providing uninterrupted access to resources
across both domains.

Figure 14.2 illustrates some use-cases of AWS Microsoft AD, including the
ability to grant user access to external cloud application (or Microsoft Azure)
and allow on-premises AD users to manage and access resources in the AWS
cloud.

Sharing a CodeBuild project using AWS RAM

AWS RAM allows customers to share their resources across multiple
AWS accounts within their organization or organizational units It employs
Identity Access Management roles and users for supported resource types.
With multiple AWS accounts, users can create a resource (only for
supported resource types) in one account and allow other accounts to
reuse them.

The following are the key benefits of AWS RAM:
• Minimizes operational Create and share resources across accounts with
AWS RAM, eliminating the need to duplicate resources and reducing
operational tasks. It streamlines access control within the owning account,
avoiding complex identity-based policies.

• Ensures security and Manage the security of shared resources effectively
with a unified set of policies and permissions, avoiding the hassle of
maintaining identical settings across multiple accounts. AWS RAM
ensures a uniform experience for sharing various AWS resources.

• Enhances visibility and AWS RAM, integrated with Amazon
CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail, offers clear insights into shared
resource usage and account activity, bolstering visibility and auditability.

In the following section, we will provide a hands-on example
demonstrating how to share a CodeBuild project using AWS RAM.

Intrusion detection with AWS Network Firewall

AWS Network Firewall is a fully managed service that provides network
firewall capabilities, along with intrusion detection and prevention. This
firewall filters both inbound and outbound traffic from various sources such
as an internet gateway, NAT gateway, VPN, or AWS Connect Direct. All
requests entering a customer’s VPC can be routed first to AWS Network
Firewall for inspection.

In this section, we will establish an AWS Network Firewall within a VPC and
configure it to permit web traffic to EC2 instance located in a protected public
subnet. We will modify the existing route tables to direct traffic to and from
the EC2 instance through the firewall for security. We will create a firewall
policy and insert a stateful rule. This rule permits traffic to domains included
in Domain List and denies traffic to all others. Additionally, we will set up
CloudWatch logging to monitor any denied traffic. While this demonstration
occurs within a single availability zone for simplicity, a production
environment should utilize at least two availability zones to ensure high
availability.

For connectivity to the EC2 instance, we will use the AWS Systems Manager
Session Manager. The architecture for this use case is depicted in Figure



---

### Page 981


Figure 14.8: Architecture of AWS Network Firewall setup within a VPC

### Page 982


Pre-requisites

Before initiating the AWS Network Firewall setup, ensure the following AWS
resources are provisioned in your AWS account:
• Virtual Private Cloud IPv4 10.0.0.0/16, Hosting the AWS Network Firewall.

• Firewall Availability IPv4 CIDR 10.0.0.0/28, Housing the AWS Network
Firewall endpoint.

• Protected Workload IPv4 10.0.1.0/24.

• EC2 Instance Within ensure the Auto-assign public IP option is active
during instance creation.

• Internet Gateway Providing the VPC with internet access.

• Route tables - Include:

o  Internet Route table named my-igw-rt with the local route added.

o  Protected Workload Route table named

o  Firewall route table named my-fw-rt with both local and internet routes
added.

With these resources appropriately set up, you can proceed with the AWS
Network Firewall configuration.

Testing: In this section, we will connect to both whitelisted websites and
websites blocked by the firewall from the EC2 instance.


---

### Page 995


Navigate to your EC2 instance and connect using Session Manager. Execute
the following command on the EC2 instance:
1.  curl https://www.google.com --max-time 5

Since www.google.com is a whitelisted domain by the firewall, you should
observe a successful output from the above curl command, similar to what is
shown below in Figure


Figure 14.23: Successful output of curl command for
https://www.google.com

Now, test a domain that is not on the approved domain list, such as Execute
the following command on the EC2 instance:

1.  curl https://www.facebook.com --max-time 5

You will notice that the curl command times out with no data received as
shown in Figure




---

### Page 996


Figure 14.24: Timeout result of curl command for https://www.facebook.com

Since the web traffic is not permitted by the approved domain list, the
firewall will generate an Alert log. This can be viewed in your associated
CloudWatch log group, as shown below in Figure


Figure 14.25: Alert Log in CloudWatch triggered by attempted access to
unapproved domain

In this section, we explored AWS Network Firewall, a managed service
providing network security and intrusion detection. We configured and tested
it to control traffic flow and monitor network activity, enhancing AWS
infrastructure security. AWS Network Firewall is a valuable tool for
safeguarding workloads, and data, and detecting security threats.

RBAC versus ABAC

We are already familiar with the traditional authorized model called RBAC,
which is used in the Identity and Access Management service. In this model,
we attach policies to identities (IAM users, groups, or roles) based on a
person’s job functions. As a best practice, we grant the minimum permissions
required for the job function, which is also known as granting the least
privileges. In the IAM policy, we define the specific resources the user can
access. Figure 14.26 shows that users (or programs) are assigned (or
assumed) a role. The policy attached to the IAM role grants permission to
access S3 buckets, secrets created in AWS Secret Manager, and a kms key
created in AWS Key Management Service


Figure 14.26: RBAC authorization model

The drawback of this RBAC model is that when users (or programs) need to
access additional resources, we need to update policies to allow access to
these resources, which is less effective.


---

### Page 998


The Attribute-Based Access Control model defines permissions based on
attributes called tags. We can attach tags to IAM entities (users or roles) and
to AWS resources as shown in Figure


Figure 14.27: ABAC authorization model

Using ABAC, we can create a single or fewer policies for IAM principals.
These ABAC policies can be designed to allow operations when the
principal’s tag matches the resource tag. Here are the advantages of using the
ABAC model:
• Scalability: ABAC permissions scale effortlessly with innovation. No need
to update policies for new resources.

• Simplified policies: ABAC requires fewer policies, making management
more efficient. Create and manage fewer policies without the complexity of
## RBAC.

• Agility: Teams can change and grow swiftly. Permissions for new resources
are automatically granted based on attributes. Adding new projects or
reassigning team members is hassle-free.


---

### Page 999


• Granular control: Achieve granular permissions by matching resource tags
with principal tags. Only allow actions if the tags match.

Below is a simple AWS IAM policy example that demonstrates ABAC
principles by granting read access to Amazon S3 objects based on specific
tag-keys and tag-values:

1.  {

2.   "Version": "2012-10-17",

3.   "Statement": [

4.     {

5.       "Sid": "AllowReadAccessBasedOnTags",

6.       "Effect": "Allow",

7.       "Action": "s3:GetObject",

8.        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*",

9.       "Condition": {

10.         "StringEquals": {



---

### Page 1000

11.           "s3:ExistingObjectTag/tag-key": "department",

12.           "s3:ExistingObjectTag/tag-value": "finance"

13.         }

14.       }

15.     }

16.   ]

17.  }

This above policy demonstrates how we can use ABAC to control access to
S3 objects based on their tags. Users or roles with this policy attached will be
able to read objects in the specified bucket only if those objects have the tag
department with a value of finance.

Identity Federation Techniques

In an Identity federation system, an Identity Provider is responsible for user
authentication, while the Service Provider controls access to the resources. In
this system, both parties, the IdP and SP, trust each other to authenticate users
and convey the information needed to authorize their access to the resources.
This approach is useful when the organizations have their own identity
system such as corporate directory and they do not want to manage user
identities in AWS.

AWS offers two services to federate corporate workforce identities into AWS
accounts: AWS Identity Center or AWS IAM. Following are the commonly
used open identity standards used in AWS for federation:
• Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0)

• Open ID Connect

• OAuth 2.0

Each of these federation protocols offers distinct mechanisms and standards
for secure user authentication and resource access across various platforms.
Let us delve into how AWS incorporates these protocols within its federation
services:
• Federation with AWS Identity AWS Identity Center simplifies the
management of federated access across multiple AWS accounts and business
applications. It provides users with single sign-on access to their assigned
accounts and applications from a single location. AWS Identity Center can


---

### Page 1002

also act as an IdP to authenticate users for applications integrated with AWS
Identity Center, as well as for cloud-based applications that are compatible
with SAML 2.0, such as Salesforce, Box, and Microsoft 365, utilizing the
directory of your choice.

You can use the AWS IAM Identity Center for identities in the AWS IAM
Identity Center’s user directory, your existing corporate directory, or an
external IDP as shown in Figure


Figure 14.28: Federating identities with AWS Identity Center

• Federation with Federation with IAM allows short-term, small-scale
deployment of federated user access using SAML 2.0 and OIDC IdPs. It
enables passing user attributes, like cost center or title, for fine-grained access
control.

• Federation with AWS Amazon Cognito identity pools enable mobile and
web app authentication and authorization. They provide IAM credentials for
accessing AWS resources, acquired through temporary sessions using
AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity API Operation. Cognito supports external and

social identity providers such as Facebook, Google and LinkedIn for flexible
user sign-in and resource access.

Questions

1. Your organization has established a multi-account AWS setup to
streamline the development and deployment process. This setup consists
of four distinct accounts: and Developers commit code to an AWS
CodeCommit repository in the ToolsAccount serves as the central hub for
CI/CD tools like AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild, while
TestAccount and ProdAccount are used for deploying applications for
testing and production respectively.

When a developer checks in a sample code for an AWS Lambda function
in the DevAccount, it is expected to automatically trigger a CI/CD
pipeline. This pipeline, residing in the should run the build using AWS
CodeBuild and subsequently deploy the Lambda function to both the Test
and Prod accounts.
Which of the following solutions would best achieve this workflow?

a.  Configure AWS CodePipeline in the DevAccount to detect changes in
CodeCommit, run the build in the DevAccount using AWS CodeBuild,
and deploy to TestAccount and

b.  Set up an AWS CodePipeline in the ToolsAccount to detect changes in
the CodeCommit repository in the use AWS CodeBuild in the
ToolsAccount for building, and deploy to TestAccount and



---

### Page 1012

c.  Create individual AWS CodePipelines in each of the accounts: and with
each handling its specific part of the workflow.

d.  Utilize AWS CodeBuild in the DevAccount to detect changes, build the
code, and then manually deploy to TestAccount and ProdAccount using
## AWS CLI.

2. Your company has implemented a multi-region API Gateway with
CloudFront. This architecture is designed to reduce latency for end-users
by offering API Gateway endpoints in multiple AWS regions. Each
endpoint supports read-local write-global data synchronization through the
Amazon Aurora global database. As part of the global deployment,
Lambda@Edge functions are used to enhance performance and minimize
latency for global clients. These functions produce logs in CloudWatch
that are pushed to the AWS region nearest to the execution point.

To effectively troubleshoot potential issues and analyze the
Lambda@Edge logs, you are considering a strategy to aggregate these
logs from all regions into a single AWS region. Which two of the
following approaches are the most cost-effective and recommended for
this scenario?
a.  Create a Kinesis Data Firehose data stream in all the AWS regions that
are closest to your end viewers to deliver the logs.

b.  Create a Kinesis Data Firehose data stream in one primary AWS region
and set up a CloudWatch IAM role to allow CloudWatch to send logs from
all AWS regions to the Kinesis Firehose delivery stream.



---

### Page 1013

c.  To ensure that each region has a log group, create a CloudFormation
stack set that deploys CloudFormation stacks across all regions to
establish the log groups if they do not already exist. Then, create a second
CloudFormation stack set that deploys stacks across all regions to set up
filters for capturing logs.

d.  Use CloudWatch Logs subscription filters with AWS Lambda functions
to collect logs from all regions and then use AWS Lambda to consolidate
and push them to a single Kinesis Data Firehose stream in a centralized
logging region.

3. You are tasked with implementing a canary deployment for an AWS
Lambda function, with the goal of choosing the method that requires the
least manual effort and is easiest to implement. Which of the following
options would best meet these criteria?

a.  Developing a Python script to automate the deployment process: This
script updates the $LATEST version of the Lambda function, publishes a
new version, and gradually shifts traffic to the new version by adjusting
the alias. It includes health checks and automatically rolls back to the
original version if any issues are detected.

b.  Creating a state machine in AWS step functions: This state machine
performs similar tasks as the Python script but runs as an asynchronous
workflow. It incrementally updates the new version weight, waits based on
a defined interval, and performs health checks between updates. The
workflow automatically rolls back to the original version upon health
check failure.

The workflow begins with a developer deploying code to the CodeCommit
repository in the Dev Account. Upon this deployment, CodePipeline in the
Tools Account is activated. As part of the integration process, CodeBuild
compiles the code, producing a YAML artifact stored in an S3 bucket.
CodePipeline then handles the deployment of a CloudFormation template to
the Test Account, setting up the application in a test environment. Here,
developers or testers can review and either approve or reject the application’s
changes. If approved, the Serverless Application, using components like API
Gateway and Lambda, is deployed to the Production Account for end-users.
This process highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of the mentioned
solution, ensuring smooth deployment across different AWS accounts. The
workflow is illustrated in the provided in Figure

To aggregate Lambda@Edge logs efficiently, you start by creating a Kinesis
Data Firehose delivery stream in your primary AWS region using a
CloudFormation template. This stream will act as the central repository for
the logs. This setup requires the existence of CloudWatch log groups in each
applicable region. A CloudFormation stack set is therefore used to ensure
these log groups are created across all necessary regions. Another stack set is
then deployed to apply subscription filters that gather logs from every region
where CloudFront has Regional Edge Caches. The configuration of this
solution is depicted in the Figure

This option aligns with the stated goal and problem. AWS CodePipeline and
AWS CodeBuild provide a robust platform for CI/CD, facilitating the
automation of the build and deployment processes. FluxCD, serving as a
GitOps tool, ensures that the Kubernetes infrastructure remains synchronized
with the configurations stored in the Git repository, making it an appropriate
choice for the described scenario. As depicted in Figure AWS CodeCommit
stores both the application repository and the Kubernetes infrastructure
repository. A commit in the application repository triggers the pipeline’s
Source stage, which then clones the repository code. AWS CodeBuild
processes and pushes the container application to the AWS ECR repository.
After the Docker image is pushed to Amazon ECR, FluxCD retrieves the
image, ensuring synchronization of the Kubernetes infrastructure according to
our YAML definition file in the Kubernetes infrastructure CodeCommit
repository.

CloudFormation custom resources fill the gap when there is a need for
managing resources not natively supported by CloudFormation. These
custom resources allow for writing custom provisioning logic within
CloudFormation templates. This custom logic, often backed by AWS Lambda
functions, is executed during various stack operations like creation, updating,
or deletion. It enables a wide range of scenarios, such as dynamically looking
up AMI IDs or utilizing utility functions, thus extending the capabilities of
CloudFormation beyond its default offerings. Options a, c, and d do not
accurately represent CloudFormation’s approach to handling unsupported

31. The correct answers are a and

Enabling versioning on both source and destination S3 buckets a is essential
for cross-region replication, as it manages and preserves versions of objects, a
key requirement for compliance. Creating a specific IAM role for replication
and attaching the necessary IAM policy c provides the required permissions
for S3 to perform cross-region replication. Other options like setting up S3
event notifications, manually copying objects, or establishing a Direct
Connect are not directly involved in the setup of cross-region replication for
compliance purposes.

The correct answers are a, c, and

In setting up a resilient Amazon CloudFront distribution, crucial steps include
creating a secondary S3 bucket a) with live replication from the primary
bucket, ensuring up-to-date content in the failover bucket. Then, establishing
a secondary origin in CloudFront c) for this secondary S3 bucket is necessary.
Finally, creating an origin group d) that combines the primary and secondary
S3 origins within CloudFront enables automatic switching to the secondary
origin in case the primary becomes unavailable, thus ensuring continuous
content delivery and high availability.

### Page 1099


AWSSupport-TroubleshootCodeDeploy.

The correct answer is

When AWS Config identifies an EC2 instance using an unauthorized AMI as
noncompliant, it creates an OpsItem in AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter.
This OpsItem includes details about the non-compliant resource and any
actions taken to investigate or remediate the issue. To address these
compliance issues, an AWS SSM Automation document can be triggered
automatically. This document can perform actions like stopping or
terminating the noncompliant instance, offering an automated and efficient
way to ensure compliance with organizational policies.

The correct answer is

Explanation: The correct answer is c, which highlights the use of Amazon
EventBridge for a scalable response to Amazon EBS volume disruptions.
Traditional methods, limited to notifying a primary contact, are not effective
for large-scale operations. EventBridge addresses this by enabling custom
automation when an EBS volume enters an error state. This includes routing
alerts to the appropriate teams or systems using Amazon SNS or SQS, and
employing AWS Lambda for automatic recovery, such as restoring from a
snapshot, ensuring a timely and efficient response.

The correct answer is

Explanation: The correct workflow involves using AWS EventBridge to
receive findings from AWS GuardDuty. An EventBridge rule is set to forward


---

### Page 1100

these events, specifically from the GuardDuty service to two targets. The first
target is a Kinesis Firehose stream, which is responsible for delivering the
findings to DataDog. Here, the data can be visualized and analyzed on
dashboards. The same stream also sends the findings to an S3 bucket for
secure, long-term archiving. The second target is an SNS topic, which is used
to send email notifications whenever new findings are detected. This ensures
that the relevant parties are promptly informed and can take necessary
actions. This solution provides a robust mechanism for monitoring,
visualizing, and retaining security findings within an AWS environment.

Option b correctly combines all elements of the desired security scanning
workflow. It uses AWS EventBridge to automate the initiation of AWS
Inspector scans on a schedule defined by a cron expression. AWS Inspector
then conducts the scans and exports the findings to AWS Security Hub.
Security Hub provides an integrated view of the security posture of the AWS
account, helping to ensure compliance with industry standards and best
practices. Finally, AWS SNS is utilized to send email notifications to
stakeholders when the ASSESSMENT_RUN_COMPLETED event occurs,
ensuring timely communication about the scan’s completion and findings.

Explanation: Option c describes an automated solution that aligns with the
given architecture workflow for data protection. In this workflow, Amazon
Macie is used to discover sensitive data at a scale. When Macie detects
sensitive data, it runs a classification job and publishes the findings to AWS
EventBridge in the form of a JSON object. An EventBridge rule is then
configured to capture these findings and invoke an AWS Lambda function as
the target. The Lambda function is responsible for parsing the JSON object
and sending a custom message to the Microsoft Teams channel, which alerts
the data protection team to evaluate and take necessary actions. This solution
ensures that the team is promptly informed about sensitive data findings,
allowing for a quick response. The entire process is depicted in Figure

Correct answer is

Store the parameter as a SecureString type and encrypt it using a customer-
managed AWS KMS key.


---

### Page 1104


Explanation: AWS SSM Parameter Store provides a secure and scalable way
to manage application configuration and secrets. For sensitive data, the best
practice is to store the parameter as a SecureString, which ensures that the
data is encrypted. Using a customer-managed AWS KMS key for encryption
adds an additional layer of security, allowing you to control and manage the
key used for encryption. This method is superior to plaintext storage (option a
and b) as it protects the data from unauthorized access. Storing parameters
directly in an S3 bucket (option d) is not a typical use case for SSM
Parameter Store, which is designed specifically for secure configuration and
secrets management.

The correct answer is

Explanation: Option b correctly identifies the step of creating a patch
baseline, which is crucial for defining which patches should be installed,
including rules for auto-approval, and specifying approved or rejected
patches. This step ensures that only the necessary and secure patches are
applied to the instances. Option d describes how to schedule the patch
installation process using maintenance windows, which allows for patches to
be applied during specific time frames that minimize the impact on the
operational environment. This is done by targeting instances using resource
tags and patch groups, which ensures that the right instances are being
patched according to the established policies. Options a, c, and e do not align
with the best practices for using SSM Patch Manager for automating and
managing patches.

Correct answers are b and

Explanation: Option b is correct because one of the key benefits of AWS

---

### Page 1105

resources, like CodeBuild projects, without the need to recreate them in each
account. It streamlines the management of access within the owner account,
avoiding complex setup. Option e is correct because AWS RAM maintains
security and consistency across shared resources with a unified set of policies,
ensuring that permissions are managed effectively and uniformly. Options a,
c, and d are incorrect because AWS RAM does not create resources in shared
accounts, automate build and deployment processes without configuration, or
provide real-time synchronization of project changes.

The correct answer is

Explanation: AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that offers network
firewall capabilities, which includes filtering traffic that enters and exits a
VPC. It supports intrusion detection and prevention, providing robust security
by inspecting traffic from various sources like internet gateways, NAT
gateways, VPNs, and AWS Direct Connect. This inspection helps to
safeguard the network against unauthorized access and other potential
security threats. Options a, b, and d do not accurately describe the primary
function of AWS Network Firewall within a VPC.

The correct answer is

Explanation: ABAC offers a more dynamic and flexible approach to access
control in AWS by utilizing tags to define permissions. Unlike RBAC, which
requires updating policies to accommodate changes in user access needs,
ABAC can automatically scale permissions with the addition of new
resources or changes in a user’s role. This is achieved through the use of tags
that associate IAM principals with specific resources. When the tags match,
the defined permissions are granted. This method supports scalability,
streamlined policy management, and adaptability to team changes or project


---

### Page 1106

growth without the need for frequent policy modifications. Options a, b, and
d do not accurately capture the advantages of ABAC over RBAC.

on-premises AD. It eliminates the need for manual maintenance, thereby
streamlining Active Directory operations in the cloud. Options a, c, and d do
not correctly describe the managed nature of AWS Managed Microsoft AD or
its capabilities.

The correct answers are and

Explanation: AWS CloudHSM offers customers a highly secure and
compliant way to manage cryptographic keys and operations within the AWS
Cloud. One of the key benefits is the use of FIPS 140-2 Level-3 validated
HSMs, which are standards-compliant and dedicated per customer, providing
flexibility that managed services with fixed algorithms might not offer.


---

### Page 1107

Another significant advantage is that the data plane within CloudHSM is fully
encrypted and not accessible to AWS, providing customers with full control
over their cryptographic keys and user management, distinct from IAM roles.
Furthermore, AWS CloudHSM facilitates a smooth migration for existing
cryptographic applications to the cloud, supporting common standards and
minimizing the need for changes to applications. Option a is incorrect
because CloudHSM provides single-tenant HSM instances, not shared, and
option d is incorrect as AWS handles the hardware and software maintenance
of CloudHSM instances.

operations, coupled with high availability and low latency. Additionally,
AWS CloudHSM automates management tasks like backups,
provisioning, configuration, and maintenance, offering complete control
over HSMs in the AWS Cloud. Other options either lack dedicated HSMs
or do not provide the comprehensive feature set required for such
specialized cryptographic needs.

The correct answer is

Explanation: AWS STS is the ideal service for this scenario. It allows the
creation of temporary security credentials for users who need to access
AWS resources. These credentials work similarly to long-term access key
credentials but have a limited lifetime and are generated dynamically,
providing a secure way to grant access without distributing permanent
credentials or creating an AWS identity for each user. Options a, c, and d
do not offer the same level of temporary, dynamic credential management
as AWS STS.

The correct answer is

Explanation: AWS Security Hub is designed to provide a comprehensive
view of your security state within AWS, making it ideal for this scenario.
It helps assess your environment against various security industry
standards and best practices, collects and analyzes security data from
AWS accounts, AWS services, and third-party products, and generates
control findings for compliance assessment. Additionally, Security Hub
offers automation features for managing and remediating security issues

and integrates with Amazon EventBridge for automated responses.
Options a, c, and d, while useful for specific security and compliance
tasks, do not offer the broad, integrated, and automated capabilities
provided by AWS Security Hub.

The correct answer is

Explanation: AWS CodeStar is specifically designed to address the
requirements outlined in the scenario. It enables quick development,
building, and deployment of applications on AWS, and provides a unified
user interface for managing various software development activities.
CodeStar facilitates the rapid setup of a continuous delivery toolchain and
supports team collaboration. It also includes an integrated project
management dashboard with issue tracking capabilities, making it an ideal
choice for a comprehensive development environment that includes all the
mentioned features. The other options, while useful in specific aspects of
CI/CD, do not offer the holistic solution provided by AWS CodeStar.

The correct answer is

Explanation: Amazon Cognito is an ideal solution for this scenario, as it is
specifically designed as an identity platform for web and mobile apps. It
supports authentication from a built-in user directory, enterprise
directories, and consumer identity providers like Google and Facebook.
Cognito also handles the issuance of OAuth 2.0 access tokens and AWS
credentials for authorized users, making it a comprehensive choice for the
application’s authentication and authorization needs. Options a, c, and d,
while relevant for identity and access management, do not offer the same
level of integrated, multi-source authentication capabilities as Amazon
Cognito.

The correct answer is

Explanation: AWS Step Functions is the most appropriate service for this
scenario. It is a serverless orchestration service that enables you to build
complex workflows by integrating with AWS Lambda and other AWS
services. Step Functions provide a graphical console to visualize the
workflows as state machines, where each step or state can represent a unit
of work performed by services like AWS Lambda or AWS Glue. This
service allows you to effectively manage and visualize the state of each
step in your workflow, ensuring that the application runs in order and as
expected, which is crucial for processes involving data transformation,
machine learning, and human interaction tasks. Options a, c, and d, while
useful for certain aspects of workflow management, do not offer the
comprehensive orchestration and visualization capabilities of AWS Step
Functions.
